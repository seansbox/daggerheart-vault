*“My ancestors used their gift to track beasts in the swamps. I use mine to find fugitives in the slums of Sharn. I'm still a hunter. I always find my mark.” — Hondar'Aashta, Tharashk bounty hunter*

The Mark of Finding sharpens the senses, guiding the hunter to prey. Alone among the dragonmarks, the Mark of Finding is carried by two races: humans and half-orcs. It first appeared in the Shadow Marches, where clan hunters used it to find their prey.
