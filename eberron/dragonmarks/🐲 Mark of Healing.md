*“What's the price of a life? Well, I've got a rate sheet right over here. I'd be happy to discuss it.” — Bessi d'Jorasco, Fairhaven healer*

A halfling with the Mark of Healing can save a life with a touch, restoring vitality and the will to live. When dealing with mundane medicine, the mark helps its bearer sense the nature of maladies, aiding them in finding a cure. When equipped with dragonshard focus items, the mark can even draw the dead back from the depths of Dolurrh.
