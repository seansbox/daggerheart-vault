*“Protection is my purpose. I defend the innocent from those who would do them harm. For my siblings, this is a job; for me, it's a calling.” — Harric d'Deneith, Sentinel Marshal*

The Mark of Sentinel warns and protects. It heightens senses and reflexes, allowing an heir to respond to threats with uncanny speed. It can shield its bearer from harm. Whether on the battlefield or the ballroom, someone who carries the Mark of Sentinel is prepared for danger.
