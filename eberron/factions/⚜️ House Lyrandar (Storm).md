*Half-elf. Air and sea transportation.* [[🐲 Mark of Storm]]

**Leader:** Esravash d'Lyrandar

**Headquarters:** Stormhome (Aundair)

House Lyrandar has long ruled the seas. Their kraken-marked galleons harness air and water elementals and are faster than any mundane vessel. Control of sea and river trade gave Lyrandar considerable power. Now they reach out to the skies. Merely a decade old, Lyrandar airships have undermined the lightning rail's domination of overland travel.

House Lyrandar also controls the air in a literal way. The Raincallers' Guild can use the Mark of Storms to control the weather for its clients.

For many of the house's members, the house is more than a family or business—its private island enclave, Stormhome, is the closest thing they have to a homeland. Baron Esravash is ambitious and often steers the house to act in what she sees as the interests of all half-elves. Lyrandar heirs help the Valenar elves run their young kingdom, and some believe that Valenar could become a true homeland for the Khoravar.
