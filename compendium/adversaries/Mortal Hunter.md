### Terrifying - Passive

Every time this creature makes a successful attack, all PCs within Far range lose one Hope. *“They strike you with silent satisfaction, and their claws rend more than flesh as your confidence sinks.”*

### Deathlock - Action

Spend a Fear to put a deathlock on a target within Very Close range as the Mortal Hunter binds the target with a necrotic curse. Any attacks made by the Mortal Hunter on a deathlocked target deal direct damage. This creature can only maintain one deathlock at a time. *“They make a pattern with their hands and a sigil burns into you as it feels like something has wrapped cold hands around your heart.”*

### Inevitable Death - Action

Mark Stress to activate 1d4 adversaries under the Mortal Hunter’s control. They deal half damage with any attacks made in these activations. *“The Hunter snaps, and the dead around you leap into action.”*

### Rampage - Reaction

Countdown (Loop 1d6) Activate when a hostile target is spotted. When triggered, move in a straight line to somewhere in Far range, and make an attack with a +3 modifier against all enemies in the path. Deal 2d8+12 physical damage to any you succeed against. *“Hatred burns in their eyes, and they shoot forward with a blur, tearing through everything in their path.”*
