### Flying - Passive

Attack rolls against this adversary while it is flying are at +3 difficulty. *“The bats twists and soars through the air, evading your strikes.”*

### Guardian - Reaction

When any Vampire allies mark HP, you can mark Stress and have this adversary fly into melee with the attacker to make an attack at advantage against the creature that attacked the vampire. If successful, the target takes 2d6+2 phy. *“The bat dives in front of your blow, protecting its master.”*

### Screech - Action

Mark Stress to send a high-pitch screech out toward all targets in front of the Dire Bat within Far range. They must all mark 1d4 Stress. *“The bat’s screech grates your spirit, taxing and infuriating at once.”*
