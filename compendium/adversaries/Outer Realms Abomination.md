### Chaotic Form - Passive

Each time this adversary attacks, roll 2d4 and use that as their attack modifier (as reflected in the attack modifier section). *“The beast’s form is constantly in flux, attacking with a differently-shaped pseudopod each time.”*

### Disorienting Presence - Passive

Targets damaged by this adversary must make an Instinct Reaction Roll (21). On a failure, they immediately place a token on the action tracker. *“The abomination’s strikes come at odd angles and attack your very sense of self, disrupting your battlefield awareness.”*

### Unreal Form - Reaction

When this adversary takes damage, reduce that damage by 1d20. *“Your blow hits the creature’s form as if it was rock. No, wood. It’s different every time.”*

### Reality Quake - Action

Spend a Fear to rattle the edges of reality near this adversary. All targets within Far range must make a Knowledge Reaction Roll (21). Any who fail become un-stuck from reality until the end of the scene. While an un-stuck target spends Hope or Armor Slots or marks Hit Points or Stress, they must always spend/mark double the amount. Targets that succeed mark a Stress. *“The creature twists into itself, then pulses, shaking the walls of reality and untethering you from this realm.”*
