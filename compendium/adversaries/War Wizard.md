### Battle Teleport - Passive - Spell

War Wizard may mark Stress to teleport to a location within a Far distance before or after making a basic attack. *“They pop in and out, nearly impossible to pin down.”*

### Warding Sphere - Reaction - Spell

When War Wizard takes damage from an attack within Close range, the attacker takes 2d4+3 magic damage. On a result of 10+, this ability deactivates until War Wizard marks Stress to reactivate it. *“Part of the force of your blow reflects back on you.”*

### Eruption - Action - Spell

Mark Stress and choose a point within a Far range. A Very Close area around that point erupts into impassable terrain. Anyone within that area must make an Agility Reaction Roll (14) or be thrown back by a Close distance and take 2d10+4 physical damage. Targets that succeed are not moved and take half damage. *“The Wizard points and the ground detonates, throwing you back.”*

### Arcane Artillery - Action - Spell

Spend a Fear to unleash a precise hail of magical blasts. Every opponent within Far range takes 2d10+10 magic damage. Characters may make an Agility Reaction Roll (15) to take half damage. *“They raise their staff and call down a hailstorm of magical bolts.”*
