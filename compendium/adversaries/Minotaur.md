### Slow (2) - Passive

This adversary costs 2 action tokens to activate. *“The enemy moves slowly, but with incredible strength.”*

### Charging Bull - Action

Spend a Fear to make an attack roll on a group within Very Close range. The Minotaur charges through them, making an attack. Any they succeed against are knocked back to Close range and take 2d10+10 phy damage. If they are knocked into a solid object or another creature, they take an additional 1d8+3 phy (add the damage together). *“The Minotaur lowers their head and charges, knocking you back with incredible force.”*

### Gore - Action

Make an attack against a target within Very Close range, moving the Minotaur into melee with them. On a success, deal 2d6+15 phy damage to the target. Armor is only worth half its value against this attack. *“The Minotaur slashes and stabs with their huge horns, punching through your armor.”*
