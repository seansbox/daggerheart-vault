### Slow (2) - Passive

This adversary costs 2 action tokens to activate. *“They move slowly, but with great power.”*

### Crushing Blows - Passive

All targets hit by Greater Earth Elemental must mark an armor after taking damage (separate from reducing damage). *“The elemental hits you with the force of a falling mountain.”*

### Immovable Object - Passive

Any attack that would move Greater Earth Elemental moves it two fewer ranges (Far becomes Very Close, etc.) Whenever Greater Earth Elemental takes physical damage, reduce that damage by 7. *“The elemental holds their ground, unmoved by your attack.”*

### Rockslide - Action

Mark a Stress to create a rockslide in the Close area in front of Greater Earth Elemental. All creatures in this area must make an Agility Reaction Roll (19) or take 2d12+15 physical damage and become Vulnerable until their next roll with Hope. On a successful reaction roll, they take half damage. *“The elemental transforms into a living rockslide, barreling over you and trying to crush you beneath its form.”*
