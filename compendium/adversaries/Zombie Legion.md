### Unyielding - Passive

Zombie Legion has resistance to physical damage. *“Your blows carve flesh like lumber, but they seem to ignore their injuries.”*

### Relentless (2) - Passive

Zombie Legion may activate twice in a GM move (still takes two action tokens). *“The horde keeps coming, never stopping their attack.”*

### Overwhelm - Reaction

When a creature within Melee distance deals damage to Zombie Legion but it does not cause Zombie Legion to mark at least Major damage, mark a Stress to have Zombie Legion immediately make an attack against that creature with advantage. *“The legion surrounds you, two closing in for every one you fell.”*

### Horde (2d6+10) - Passive

If Zombie Legion has half or more of its Hit Points marked, its attack only deals 2d6+10 phy damage. *“Their numbers diminished, the legion doesn’t pose as much of a threat.”*
