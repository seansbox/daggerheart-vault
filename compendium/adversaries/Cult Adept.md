### Fear is Fuel - Reaction

When a PC rolls a failure with Fear, clear a Stress. Usable up to twice per scene. *“As the fight grows more desperate, the Adept seems refreshed.”*

### Enervating Blast - Action

Make a standard attack. On a success, mark a Stress to cause the target to mark Stress in addition to the normal results. *“The blast ripples across your body as you writhe in pain.”*

### Shroud of the Fallen - Action - Spell

Mark a Stress to wrap an ally within Close distance in a shroud of protection. While so protected, the target has resistance to all damage. *“They conjure a dark cloud of concentrated magical shadow, which blunts some of the strength of your attacks.”*

### Shadow Shackles - Action - Spell

Spend a Fear and choose a point within Far range. All targets within Close range of that point are bound up in smoky chains and become temporarily Restrained. Each time they act while within the target area, they add two action tokens to the action tracker, not one. They can break free of the restraints with a Strength roll or by spending 2 Hope. *“Thick chains of smoke wrap themselves around you, binding you in place.”*
