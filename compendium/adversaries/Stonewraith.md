### Stonestrider - Passive

Stonewraith can move through stone and earth as if it was sand/rough terrain. They only need to surface air once every twenty minutes and use Stonesense to identify pockets of air in tunnels and the surface. *“The beast leaps into the stone wall like it was merely sand.”*

### Rocky Ambush - Action

Mark a Stress as Stonewraith leaps from within stone/earth to attack a target. The target must make an Agility or Instinct Reaction Roll (15) or take 2d8+12 phy damage and become temporarily Vulnerable until they take their next action. *“They burst from the wall to tackle you to the floor and rend you with their teeth.”*

### Avalanche Roar - Action

Spend a Fear to roar and cause a cave-in. All targets within Close must make an Agility (14) Reaction Roll or suffer 2d10+10 phy damage. The rubble can be cleared with a Completion Countdown (8). *“Their voice resonates with the stone. The ceiling cracks and comes tumbling down all around you.”*
