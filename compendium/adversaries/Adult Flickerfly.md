### Relentless (3) - Passive

Flickerfly may activate three times in one GM move (still costs 3 action tokens). *“The Flickerfly moves with incredible speed, striking like the wind.”*

### Never Misses - Passive

All Evasion scores are halved (rounded up) against the Adult Flickerfly. *“The Flickerfly moves so fast that you’re on the back foot as you try to evade.”*

### Flight - Passive

Flickerfly may move up to Far range as part of an activation while flying. *“Their glowing wings buzz as the Flickerfly darts around the battlefield.”*

### Whirlwind - Action (2)

Make a spin attack, slashing at all Very Close targets. On any you succeed against, deal 2d10+6 physical damage. Armor is only half as effective when reducing this damage. *“The Flickerfly spins, wings slashing all around it in an intricate pattern.”*

### Mind Dance - Action

Spend a Fear to create a magically dazzling display that grapples the minds of its targets. All creatures within Close range must make an Instinct Reaction Roll. On a failure, the target adds a token to the action tracker and the Flickerfly learns a fear the target has. *“Their shimmering wings catch the light and flash, enrapturing you and surfacing deep-seeded fears.”*

### Hallucinatory Breath - Action

Countdown (Loop 1d6) Activate the first time the Flickerfly takes damage. When triggered, the Flickerfly breathes hallucinatory gas on all targets in front of them up to Far range. Targets must make an Instinct Reaction Roll (17) or be tormented by fearful hallucinations. Targets whose fears are known to the Flickerfly have disadvantage on this roll. On a failure, the target loses 2 Hope and takes 3d8+3 mag damage that cannot be reduced by armor. *“The gas seeps in and your vision fills with terrifying visions that shake your confidence.”*

### Uncanny Reflexes - Reaction

Flickerfly may mark Stress when taking damage from an attack within Close range to only take half damage (rounded up). *“The Flickerfly starts to dodge your attack almost before you’ve begun to make your attack.”*
