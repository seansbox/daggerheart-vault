### Money Talks - Passive

All attacks against Demon of Greed are made at disadvantage unless the attacker spends a handful of gold. When a character marks HP from an attack by Demon of Avarice, they can spend a bag of gold instead of marking HP (1 bag per HP). Add a gold token to Demon of Avarice for each handful or bag of gold spent by PCs on this feature. *“The demon taunts you, saying that you must pay for the privilege of fighting it on fair terms.”*

### Number Must Go Up - Passive

Always add a bonus to Demon of Greed’s attacks equal to the number of gold tokens it has. *“As it accumulates wealth, the demon’s attacks are becoming more powerful.”*

### Money Is Time - Action

Spend 3 gold tokens (or a Fear) to activate 1d4+1 allies, including allies that have already activated this GM turn. *“Some of the demon’s gold disintegrates and their allies leap into action.”*
