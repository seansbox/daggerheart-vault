### Relentless (3) - Passive

Young Ice Dragon may activate three times in one GM move. *“The dragon moves with peerless speed.”*

### Rend and Crush - Passive

If a target damaged by Young Ice Dragon does not mark armor to reduce damage, they must mark a Stress. *“The dragon’s icy claws chill your blood.”*

### Terrifying - Passive

Any character that rolls a result with Fear within Far range of this adversary loses a Hope. *“The dragon’s presence heightens all your fears.”*

### Blizzard Breath - Action (3)

All creatures in front of the Young Ice Dragon within Close range must make an Agility Reaction Roll (19). On a failure, they take 4d6+5 magic damage and become Restrained by shards of ice until they break free with a Strength roll. Targets that succeed on the Reaction Roll must mark 2 Stress or take half damage. This uses all three of this adversary’s activations. *“The dragon unleashes an icy blast that freezes you in place.”*

### Avalanche - Action - Fear

Spend a Fear to have the Dragon unleash a huge downfall of snow and ice, covering all targets within Far range. All PCs within the area must make an Instinct Reaction Roll (18) or be buried in snow and rocks, becoming Vulnerable until the next time they act. Each target that fails the roll also adds a token to the action tracker. *“The dragon leaps up and beats their wings, causing an avalanche of snow and rocks.”*

### Frozen Scales - Reaction

Any character that hits the Young Ice Dragon from within Very Close range becomes chilled, giving them disadvantage on Attack Rolls until their next short rest or when they next clear Stress. *“A burst of icy air stiffens your joints.”*
