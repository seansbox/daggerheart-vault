### Opportunist - Passive

When two or more adversaries are very close to a target, all damage the archer deals to them is doubled. *“Seeing their opportunity, they pull back and let loose an arrow.”*

### Deadly Shot - Action

Make an attack against a Vulnerable target within Far range. On a success, mark a Stress to deal 3d4+8 damage. *“Their arrow finds you, exploiting your vulnerability to sink itself deep.”*
