### Armor Shredding Shards - Passive

Any successful melee attacks against this creature also mark an armor slot on the attacker. *“Though the strike hits true, its glass scales shred your armor.”*

### Spinning Serpent - Action

Mark a Stress to make an attack against all targets within Very Close range. Any target hit takes 1d8+5 phy damage. *“It spins violently, its sharp body striking in every direction.”*

### Spitter - Action

Spend a Fear to introduce a Spitter d6 die. Anytime the Glass Snake activates, roll this die. On a 5+, all targets in front of the snake within Far range must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or take 2d6+3 damage. This does not use the snake’s activation. *“Hundreds of shards of pearlescent glass spiral towards you.”*
