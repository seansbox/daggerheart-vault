### Slow (2) - Passive

The GM must spend two initiative tokens to activate Huge Green Ooze. *“The ooze moves slowly, but with determined force.”*

### Acidic Form - Passive

Any creature damaged by Huge Green Ooze must also mark one Armor Slot. This does not reduce any damage. *“The ooze melts your armor wherever it touches you.”*

### Envelop - Action

Make an attack against a target in melee. On a success, they must mark 2 Stress as they are enveloped. Every time an action token is placed on the tracker, they must mark an additional Stress. They will break free the next time the ooze takes Severe damage or on a Strength (17) action roll by another character to pull them out. *“The ooze encircles you, drawing you into its acidic gelatinous form.”*

### Split - Reaction

When this adversary marks its 4th Hit Point, spend a Fear to split it into two Green Oozes (with no marked HP or Stress) that instantly activate. *“Just when you thought you had it on the ropes, the ooze splits into two smaller oozes, which immediately attack.”*
