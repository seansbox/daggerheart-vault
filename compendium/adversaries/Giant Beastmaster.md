### Pinning Strike - Action

Make a Longbow attack against a target. On a success, the Beastmaster may also mark a Stress to pin them to a nearby surface. A pinned target is Restrained until freed with a Finesse or Strength Roll (16). *“Their arrow punches through you and pins you to the nearby terrain.”*

### Deadly Companion - Action

Up to twice per scene, summon a Bear, Dire Wolf, or similar Tier 0 Beast under this adversary’s control. That beast appears at a Close range and immediately activates. *“They blow a whistle and a trained beast emerges, charging forward at the giant’s command.”*

### Two as One - Passive

When this adversary activates, you can also activate a Tier 0 Beast currently under this adversary’s control. *“The beast and giant move in perfect sync, closing in together.”*
