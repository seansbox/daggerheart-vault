### Slippery - Reaction

When this adversary takes damage from an opponent, they teleport away up to Far range. *“As soon as your blow lands, the sorcerer disappears in a plume of sulfrous smoke and repositioned.”*

### Shackles of Guilt - Action

Countdown (Loop 2d6) Activate when a hostile creature is spotted. It will tick down every time a token is placed on the action tracker. When triggered, all targets within Far range become Vulnerable as they relive their greatest regrets. All targets immediately mark Stress. They may roll with Presence or Strength (18) to try to break free. Each time a character fails to break free, they lose Hope. *“The sorcerer raises their arms and you feel invisible chains wrap around you body and soul, crushing you with the weight of all your guilt.”*

### Conflagration - Action

Spend a Fear to make an attack roll to unleash a firestorm that consumes all opponents within Close range. Any you succeed against take 2d10+6 magic damage. The firestorm persists until the next success with Hope, and each character that begins their action in the firestorm takes 2d8+8 direct magic damage. *“The sorcerer cackles with delight as the battlefield bursts into flame.”*

### Nightmare Tableau - Action

Mark a Stress to create a powerful illusion that traps a target within Far range in a tableau of their worst fears. While trapped they are Restrained and Vulnerable, but may break free by succeeding on a roll with Instinct (18). On a failure of any kind on that roll, the GM takes a Fear. Each time a trapped character makes a roll to escape, the Fallen Sorcerer must mark Stress or 1 HP or choose to release the PC. *“All at once, you’re carried away to a terrifying vision, the battle left behind.”*
