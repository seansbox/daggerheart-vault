### Everyone Has a Price - Action

If Merchant Baron knows a target’s motive, Spend a Fear to offer a target a dangerous bargain. If used on a PC, they must make a Reaction Roll with Presence (17). If they fail, they can mark 2 Stress or take the deal. *“The baron’s eyes glimmer as they make you an offer you dare not resist.”*
