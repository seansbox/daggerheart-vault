### Our Master’s Will - Reaction

When the GM activates an ally within Far distance, Secret-Keeper may Mark Stress to add a token to the action tracker. *“The Secret-Keeper’s voice carries the weight of dread, chilling your blood.”*

### Seize Your Moment - Action

Spend a Fear to activate 1d4 allies to attack. Their attacks deal half damage. *“When they call, the cultists answer, swarming to attack.”*

### Summoning Ritual - Reaction - Spell

Countdown (6) Activate when a hostile target is spotted. When triggered, summon a Minor Demon within a Close distance. Each time Secret-Keeper marks HP, add the number of HP marked to this Countdown. *“Their leader’s hands glow with eerie light, chanting a ritual of summoning. Whatever they’re calling out to, it’s not good.”*

### Fallen Hounds - Reaction

Once per scene, when Secret-Keeper takes Major or worse damage, mark a Stress to summon a Demonic Hound Pack. They appear at a Close distance and immediately activate (no token required). *“The Secret-Keeper reels from the blow, then throws a sulfurous pouch to the ground. From it springs a pack of monstrous hounds, eager for the hunt.”*
