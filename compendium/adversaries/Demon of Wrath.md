### Anger Unrelenting - Passive

When a character marks armor to reduce damage from Demon of Wrath’s attacks, their armor is only half as effective. *“The demons’ fury powers their blows, tearing through your armor..”*

### Retaliation - Reaction

Mark Stress when Demon of Wrath takes damage from a target within Close damage to make an immediate basic attack against them. *“Incensed by your blow, the demon slashes back at you.”*

### Battle Lust - Action

Spend a Fear to boil the blood of all targets within a Far range. For the rest of the scene, they use a d20 as their Fear die instead of a d12. *“The demon roars, and something within your heart answers. You feel the pull to fight, to kill. That anger threatens to overtake you.”*

### Blood and Souls - Reaction

Countdown (Loop 6) Activate this countdown the first time an attack is made within sight of the Demon of Wrath. This Countdown only reduces when a PC takes a violent action. When triggered, Summon 1d4 Minor Demons that are drawn to the carnage. They appear at a Close distance. *“Lesser demons are drawn to the carnage, forming out of blood shed on the battlefield.”*
