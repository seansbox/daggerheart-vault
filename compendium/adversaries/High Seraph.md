### Relentless (2) - Passive

This adversary may activate twice in a GM move (still takes 2 tokens). *“The Seraph moves with impossible speed and grace.”*

### Divine Flight - Passive

High Seraph can fly a Far distance as part of an activation. *“Their wings are pure light, bearing them through the skies with ease.”*

### Judgment - Action

Spend a Fear to mark a character as Guilty in the eyes of the High Seraph’s god. Only one character may be marked by High Seraph at a time. While so marked, the target does not gain Hope on a result with Hope. When High Seraph hits a target marked as Guilty, they deal physical damage equal to 20+the target’s Major threshold (instead of their normal attack damage). *“As the High Seraph pronounces you guilty, the weight of judgment hangs on you with impossible weight.”*

### God Rays - Action

Mark a Stress to reflect a sliver of divinity as a searing beam of light that hits up to twenty targets within Very Far range. Anyone hit by the beam must make a Presence Reaction Roll (22) or suffer 4d6+8 magic damage. Targets marked as Guilty have disadvantage on this roll. Anyone that succeeds on the roll takes half damage. *“The High Seraph raises their sword, reflecting a light that is impossibly bright and sears your very soul.”*

### We Are One - Action

Activate every one of High Seraph’s allies within Far distance. Their attacks deal half damage. This uses both of High Seraph’s activations. *“Their leader commands them forward, and the host moves as one.”*
