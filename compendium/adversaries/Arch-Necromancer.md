### Dance of Death - Action

Mark a Stress to activate 1d4 additional adversaries. Any attacks they use deal ½ damage. You may also spend a Fear per attack to have them attack and deal full damage instead. *“The undead dance like marionettes on the Arch-Necromancer’s strings.”*

### Beam of Decay - Action

Mark 2 Stress to target any number of creatures within Close range in front of this adversary and anything behind them within Far range. Targets must make a Reaction roll with Strength (23) or suffer 2d20+12 magic damage (half damage on success). Any target that suffers Major or worse damage also marks 2 Stress and becomes Vulnerable until after their next action. *“The Arch-Necromancer unleashes a powerful beam of entropic energy.”*

### Your Life Is Mine - Reaction

Countdown (Loop 2d6) Activate when Arch-Necromancer has marked 6 or more of their HP. It ticks down every time a token is placed on the action tracker. When triggered, deal 2d10+6 direct magic damage to a target within Close range. Arch-Necromancer clears a number of Stress or HP equal to those marked by the target from this attack. *“A burst of power sucks life energy from you and refreshes the Arch-Necromancer’s power.”*

### Open the Gates of Death - Action

Spend a Fear to summon a Zombie Legion at Close range, which instantly activates. *“The Arch-Necromancer conjures a pack of powerful undead.”*

### Not Today, My Dears - Reaction

When this adversary has marked 8 or more of their HP, spend a Fear to have them teleport away to a safe location to recover. A character may roll with Instinct (23) to trace the teleportation magic to its destination. *“Bloodied, the Arch-Necromancer opens a portal and steps through, taunting you as they go. But when they’ve disappeared, a trail of magic remains that you might be able to follow.”*
