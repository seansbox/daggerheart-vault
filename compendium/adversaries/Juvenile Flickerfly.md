### Relentless (3) - Passive

Flickerfly may activate three times in one GM move (still costs 3 action tokens). *“The Flickerfly is everywhere at once, moving with uncanny speed.”*

### Peerless Accuracy - Passive

Before an attack the Juvenile Flickerfly makes, roll 1d6. On a 4+, the target's Evasion score is halved (rounded up). *“The Flickerfly moves so fast that you’re on the back foot as you try to evade.”*

### Mind Dance - Action

Spend a Fear to create a magically dazzling display that grapples the minds of its targets. All creatures within Close range must make an Instinct Reaction Roll. On a failure, the target adds a token to the action tracker and the Flickerfly learns a fear the target has. *“Their shimmering wings catch the light and flash, enrapturing you and surfacing deep-seeded fears.”*

### Hallucinatory Breath - Reaction

Countdown (Loop 1d6) Activate the first time the Flickerfly takes damage. When triggered, the Flickerfly breathes hallucinatory gas on all targets in front of them up to Far range. Targets must make an Instinct Reaction Roll or be tormented by fearful hallucinations. Targets whose fears are known to the Flickerfly have disadvantage on this roll. On a failure, the target marks a Stress and loses a Hope. *“The gas seeps in and your vision fills with terrifying visions that shake your confidence.”*
