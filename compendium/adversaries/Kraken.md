### Relentless (2) - Passive

May activate twice in a GM move. *“The Kraken is constantly moving, advancing and repositioning to continue their assault.”*

### Many Tentacles - Passive

When using a Tentacles attack, this adversary can make their attack roll against two targets in range per activation. This feature is inactive while Kraken has 8 or more marked HP. *“The Kraken’s countless tentacles lash out at multiple targets at once.”*

### Grapple & Drown - Action

Make an attack roll against a target within Close range. If successful, mark a Stress to have the Kraken grab them in one of its tentacles, dragging them beneath the water. They are Restrained and Vulnerable and must mark stress for every action token placed on the tracker until they are no longer grabbed. The target can break free with Strength roll or by the PCs dealing at least Major damage to the Kraken with the intent of freeing the grabbed character. *“The tentacle wraps itself around you and pulls you down to a watery grave.”*

### Boiling Blast - Action

Spend a Fear to have the Kraken spew a line of boiling water at any number of targets in a line up to Far range. All targets must make an Agility Reaction Roll (20). On a failure, they take 4d6+20 physical damage. If they use any number of armor slots to reduce the damage, they must also mark one Stress. *“The Kraken spits out a torrent of boiling water that would cook you alive in your armor.”*
