### Mistform - Reaction

When taking physical damage, this adversary can mark Stress to make an Instinct Reaction Roll. On a success, they only take half damage from the attack. *“The vampire vaporizes as you strike, part of your blow passing through them like air.”*

### Draining Bite - Action (2)

Make an attack on a target in melee to bite their neck. On a success, the target takes 3d10 phy. A target that marks HP from this attack loses a Hope and marks a Stress, then the Vampire clears 1 HP. *“The vampire locks on with their fangs, drinking deeply of your blood.”*
