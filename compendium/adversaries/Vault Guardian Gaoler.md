### Lock Up - Action

Mark a Stress to make an attack at Very Close range. If successful, the target is trapped within the center of the Gaoler. Entrapped targets are Restrained and can only attack the Gaoler until broken out with Strength (18) or until the Gaoler is destroyed. *“The Gaoler’s boxy torso swings open, trying to trap you inside their body.”*

### Blocking Shield - Passive

Any targets in Melee range have disadvantage on attack rolls. Targets trapped inside this adversary (using the Lock Up move) are immune to this effect. *“The swinging door shields interfere with your attacks.”*
