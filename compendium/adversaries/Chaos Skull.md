### Levitation - Passive

Chaos Skull levitates several feet off the ground and can’t be Restrained. *“The skull floats at eye-level and slips out of your grasp.”*

### Wards - Passive

Chaos Skull is resistant to magic damage. *“The skull absorbs part of your magic, the attack landing without the force you’d expect.”*

### Magic Burst - Action

Mark Stress to make an attack against all targets within Close range. Each target you succeed against takes 2d10+4 mag damage. *“Power bursts from the skull, searing and chilling and shocking you all at once.”*

### Siphon Magic - Action

Spend a Fear to make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, a target with a Spellcast trait marks 1d4 Stress and the Chaos Skull clears that many Stress. Additionally, on a success, Chaos Skull may immediately activate again without spending action tokens. *“The skull cackles in a hollow voice, and you feel the magical power within slipping away from you and feeding the skull.”*
