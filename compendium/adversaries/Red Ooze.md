### Creeping Fire - Action

This adversary can only move Very Close range when it activates. It lights any flammable object it touches on fire. *“It creeps towards you, the ground around it erupting into flames.”*

### Ignite - Action

Make an attack against a target in Very Close range. On a success, they burst into flames, taking 1d8+1 mag damage immediately and 2d4+2 direct magic damage every time a token is placed on the action tracker. This ends when they are extinguished with a Finesse Roll (14). *“You feel fire at your feet, and suddenly, you’re engulfed.”*

### Split - Reaction

When this adversary marks its 3rd Hit Point, spend a Fear to split it into two Tiny Red Oozes (with no marked Hit Points or Stress). They may immediately activate without spending tokens. *“You watch as the damage you’ve done splits it in half… becoming two oozes instead of one.”*
