### Won’t See It Coming - Passive

Armor is half as effective against attacks made while Master Assassin is Hidden. *“Attacking from stealth, their attack finds the gaps in your armor.”*

### Strike as One - Action

Mark a Stress to activate a number of Assassins equal to the Master Assassin’s unmarked Stress. *“Their leader whistles, and a group of assassins act as one with practiced grace.”*

### The Subtle Blade - Reaction

When Master Assassin successfully makes a Serrated Dagger attack against a character that is Vulnerable, spend a Fear to deal 3 Hit Points instead of rolling. *“Their eyes go black as the attack comes in, and the blade appears in your side, stabbing deep and ignoring your armor.”*
