### Overwhelm - Reaction

When a creature within melee range deals 1 HP to the Zombie Pack, you may mark a Stress to have the Zombie Pack immediately make an attack against that creature. *“The zombie's numbers seem insurmountable.”*

### Horde (2d4+3) - Passive

If the Zombie Pack has 3 or more of their Hit Points marked, their attack only deals 2d4+3 damage. *“With their numbers dwindling, they don’t post as much of a threat.”*
