### Grindletooth Poison - Passive

Targets that mark HP from a Poisoned Throwing Dagger attack are made Vulnerable until they clear one Hit Point. *“Your wound stings as poison courses through your body.”*

### Out of Nowhere - Passive

Assassin Poisoner has advantage on attacks if they are Hidden. *“They come at you from your flank, and you barely have time to react.”*

### Fumigation - Action

Drop a smoke bomb that fills the area within Close range with smoke, making all targets Dizzied. Dizzied characters add two tokens to the action tracker when they act, then are no longer dizzied. *“They throw something, and the air fills with a thick, cloying smoke.”*
