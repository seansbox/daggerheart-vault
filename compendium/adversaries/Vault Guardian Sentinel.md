### Kinetic Slam - Passive

Targets damaged by a Charged Mace attack are knocked back to Very Close range. *“Their blows knock you back, clearing space.”*

### Box In - Action

Mark a Stress to choose a target within Very Close range to focus on. That target adds two tokens to the action tracker each time they take an action while they remain within Very Close range of this adversary. *“The Sentinel pushes you around, fouling your weapons.”*

### Mana Bolt - Action

Spend a Fear to lob explosive magic at a spot within Far range. All targets within Very Close range of that spot must make an Agility Reaction Roll (19). On a failure, they take 2d8+20 magic damage and are knocked back into close range of where they were before. On a success, they take half damage. *“The mace glows, then the construct lobs a coruscating ball of power that explodes with incredible power.”*
