### Rending Bite - Passive

Armor is half as effective against damage from Shark’s attacks. *“The Shark’s teeth tear through your armor.”*

### Blood in the Water - Reaction

When an enemy within Close distance of Shark marks HP from an attack by another creature, the Shark may spend Stress to immediately activate to move and attack that target. *“The Shark senses wounded prey and closes in to finish you off.”*
