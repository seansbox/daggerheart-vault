### Relentless (2) - Passive

This adversary may activate twice in a GM move. *“They move with incredible speed.”*

### Consume Kindling - Reaction

When you move onto any objects that are highly flammable, consume them to clear 1 HP or 1 Stress. You may do this three times a scene. *“The Elemental spits with fire, consuming the barrels beneath it, growing stronger.”*

### Scorched Earth - Action

Mark a Stress to choose a point within Far range. The ground within Very Close range of that point immediately bursts into flames. Anyone within this area must make an Agility Reaction Roll (13), or take 2d6+5 magic damage from the flames. On a success, they take half damage instead. *“The ground glows red hot around you, suddenly bursting into flames.”*

### Explosion - Action

Spend a Fear to erupt in a fiery explosion. Make an attack against all targets within Close range. Any you succeed against are thrown back to Far range and take 3d4+10 mag damage. Armor is half as effective against this damage. *“A massive, fiery explosion rocks the battlefield.”*
