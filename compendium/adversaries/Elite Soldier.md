### Vassal’s Loyalty - Reaction

When a Knight or other noble would take damage, if the Elite Soldier is within Very Close range of the noble, mark a Stress and the Elite Soldier moves into melee to take the damage instead. *“They leap to their liege’s defense, throwing their body on your blow.”*

### Reinforce - Action

Mark a Stress to move up to a Close distance to melee range of an ally. Make an attack against a very close target. On a success, deal 2d10+10 phy damage and clear a Stress on that Close ally. *“The soldier runs up to join the fight, stabbing with ferocity and bolstering their ally.”*
