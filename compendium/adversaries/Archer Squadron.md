### Focused Volley - Action (2)

Pick a point within a Far distance. Make an attack with advantage against all targets within a Close distance of that point. Targets that are hit suffer 2d10+4 phy damage. *“Their arrows fill the air, blocking out light as they rain death upon you.”*

### Suppressing Fire - Action

Mark a Stress to target a point within a Far distance. Until the next roll with Fear, any character that moves within Close of that point must make a Reaction Roll (Agility 13) or suffer 2d6+13 physical damage. On a success, they take half damage. *“They concentrate their attention on a single point, loosing on anyone that approaches.”*

### Horde (2d6+3) - Passive

If Archer Squadron has marked ½ or more of their HP, their basic attack deals 2d6+3 phy instead of 2d6+13 phy. *“With their numbers flagging, the archers’ attacks are weaker.”*
