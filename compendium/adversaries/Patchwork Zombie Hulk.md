### Destructible - Passive

Whenever Patchwork Zombie takes Major damage or worse, it marks +1 HP. *“Your blows land harder than expected, limbs and torsos falling from the creature.”*

### Flailing Limbs - Passive

When Patchwork Zombie Hulk makes an attack, it targets all opponents within Very Close range. *“It attacks in every direction, torso-sized limbs flailing.”*

### Another For The Pile - Action

If the Patchwork Zombie Hulk is within Very Close of a corpse, it presses the cadaver to itself and incorporates it into the Hulk’s form, healing 1 HP and clearing 1 Stress. *“The hulk grabs the dead and swallows them, replacing some of its wounds and growing more energetic.”*

### Tormented Screams - Action

Mark Stress to cause all PCs within Far range to make a reaction roll (Presence 13) or lose a Hope and add a token to the action tracker. PCs that succeed mark Stress instead.
