### Relentless (2) - Passive

This adversary may activate twice in a GM move (still requires two action tokens). *“The Warlord is a paragon of battle, an unstoppable force.”*

### Doombringer - Reaction

When a character marks HP from an attack by this adversary, all PCs within Far range of the target lose Hope. *“Their blows carry the weight of doom, each one diminishing your hopes of victory.”*

### Firespite Plate Armor - Passive

Any time Realm-Breaker takes damage, reduce that damage by 2d10. *“Armor of fiery resentment protects the warlord from your blows.”*

### Tormenting Lash - Action

Mark a Stress to make a Barbed Invective Whip attack against all targets within Very Close range. Each use of armor to reduce damage from this attack requires marking two armor slots. *“The warlord whirls their lashing whip around them, eviscerating anyone within range.”*

### All-Consuming Rage - Action

Countdown (Loop 8 Decreasing) Activate when a hostile creature is spotted. This ticks down every time a token is placed on the action tracker. When triggered, create a torrent of incarnate rage that rends flesh from bone. All other creatures within Far range must make a Presence Reaction Roll (22). Any that fail take 2d6+10 magic damage that cannot be reduced by armor.. Creatures that succeed take half damage. For each HP marked, summon one Fallen Shock Troop within Very Close range of the injured target. *“The Warlord’s rage takes physical form as a cutting wind. And every time it cuts you, the wind coalesces into another Fallen servant.”*

### I Have Never Known Defeat (Phase Change) - Reaction

When Realm-Breaker marks their last HP, replace them with Undefeated Champion. You may spend a Fear to activate them immediately. *“The Warlord monologues about their inevitable victory, punctuated by transforming their whip into a massive barbed greatsword.”*
