### Terrible Knowledge - Passive

The Oracle of Doom instantly knows a personal nightmare of every mortal that comes within their sight. *“The Oracle seems to know exactly what you’re afraid of, as if it has observed your nightmares.”*

### Vengeful Fate - Reaction

Any time this adversary marks HP from an attacker within Very Close range, mark a Stress to send the attacker flying back to Far range, dealing them 2d10+10 phy damage. Damaged targets may make an Agility Reaction Roll (20) to take half damage instead. *“The Oracle bats you away as casually as you might swat a bug.”*

### Walls Closing In - Passive

Any time a target within Very Far of Oracle of Doom rolls a failure, they mark a Stress. *“Each failure adds a brick to a wall of worry that this might be your personal Doom.”*

### Pronounce Fate - Action

Fear. Spend a Fear to present a target within Far range with a vision of their personal nightmare. The target must make a Knowledge Reaction Roll (20) or lose all Hope and take 2d20+12 magic damage that cannot be reduced by armor. On a success, they take half damage and lose only 1 Hope. *“The Oracle levels a massive finger at you and you are transported to your worst nightmare.”*

### Summon Tormentors - Action

Mark a Stress to summon 2d4 minions relevant to one of the PC’s personal nightmares at Close range to the PC (Tier 2 or below). This can only be performed once per party member. *“The Oracle claps, and terrors emerge from a cloud of mist to bring your fears to life.”*
