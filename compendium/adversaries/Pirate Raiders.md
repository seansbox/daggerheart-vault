### Swashbuckler - Passive

Any incoming damage below 11 causes the attacker to mark a Stress. *“You begin to realize: you might not win this fight.”*

### Horde (2d4+3) - Passive

If a Pirate Raider has marked 2 or more of its HP, they deal 2d4+3 phy instead of their normal damage. *“With their numbers dwindling, they don’t pose as much of a threat.”*
