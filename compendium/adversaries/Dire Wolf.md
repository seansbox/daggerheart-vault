### Pack Tactics - Passive

When making a Claws attack, if another Dire Wolf is also in melee range of the target, deal 2d6+8 phy damage instead. *“When they work in packs, they’re more bold, more vicious.”*

### Hobbling Strike - Action

Make an attack against a target in melee range. On a success, mark a Stress to deal 3d4+10 phy damage and make them Vulnerable until they heal a Hit Point. *“With a snarl, they lunge at you, sinking their teeth in deep.”*
