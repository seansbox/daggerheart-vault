If Shambling Zombie is in melee range with an opponent and at least one other Zombie is within Close range, all attacks against that opponent have advantage. *“You no longer know where to look as more zombies surround you.”*

### Horrifying - Passive

When this creature deals hit point damage to a target, the target also marks Stress. *“A cold shiver goes down your spine as you face off against the corpse of someone you knew.”*
