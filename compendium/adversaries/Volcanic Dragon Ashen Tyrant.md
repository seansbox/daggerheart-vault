### Relentless (4) - Passive

This adversary may activate four times in a GM move. *“The dragon’s desperation drives them constantly forward, never letting up pressure.”*

### Injured Wings - Passive

Attack rolls against this creature while it is flying are at +1 difficulty. *“The dragon takes flight on injured wings, moving more slowly but with ample skill.”*

### Ashes to Ashes - Reaction

Whenever a target within Close distance of Ashen Tyrant rolls a failure, they lose a Hope. If they can’t, they mark a Hit Point. *“Injured and enraged, the dragon’s unrestrained presence grinds down your will to fight.”*

### Desperate Rampage - Action

Mark a Stress to make an attack against all targets within Close range. Any target hit by this attack takes 2d20+2 phy damage, marks Stress, and is knocked back to Close range. *“The dragon thrashes, slashing and swiping in every direction as they try to finish you off.”*

### Ashen Cloud - Action

Spend a Fear to smash the ground and kick up ash everywhere within Far range. Any actions involving perception through the space (including ranged attacks) are at disadvantage. Any creature taking an action within the ash cloud adds two tokens to the action tracker instead of one. This cloud clears the next time the GM spends every token on the action tracker. *“The dragon crushes the ground nearby, kicking up a great cloud of ash that obscures your vision and fills your lungs with choking despair.”*

### Apocalyptic Thrashing - Action

Countdown (1d12) Spend a Fear to activate. This ticks down every time a token is placed on the action tracker. When triggered, Ashen Tyrant thrashes about, causing environmental damage (earthquake, avalanche, collapsing walls, etc.) All targets within Far range must make a Strength Reaction Roll (18) or suffer 2d10+25 phy damage and become Restrained in the rubble. Any restrained targets can break free with Strength. Targets that succeed only take half damage and are not Restrained. If Ashen Tyrant is defeated while this countdown is active, trigger it immediately as the dragon’s death throes. *“The dragon’s thrashing causes havoc on the scale of a natural disaster, bringing down rubble and destroying their surroundings.”*
