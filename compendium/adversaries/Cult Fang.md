### Shadow’s Embrace - Passive

Cult Fang can climb and walk on vertical surfaces. Mark a Stress to move from one shadow to another within a Far distance. *“The Fang moves as if one with the darkness around them.”*

### Pick Off The Straggler - Action

Mark a Stress to move up to a Close distance and attack. The target must make a Reaction Roll (Instinct 15) or mark 2 Stress and be teleported with the Cult Fang to a shadow within a Far distance. If the target succeeds, they still mark Stress due to visions of the dread realm between shadows. *“They leap out from a shadow to grab you and pull you away with them.”*
