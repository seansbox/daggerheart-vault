### Devastating Retort - Passive

Any PC that rolls less than 17 on a social action against the Royal Advisor marks a Stress. *“The courtier laughs and says, ‘I’m sure you think so, darling, but the rest of us live in the real world.’”*

### Bend Ears - Action

Mark a Stress to influence a NPC within Very Close distance with whispered words. That noble’s opinion on one matter shifts toward the Royal Advisor’s preference unless it is direct opposition to the target’s motives. *“They lean in to whisper in the count’s ears, and you can see them changing their mind before your eyes.”*

### Scapegoat - Action

Spend a Fear to convince a target crowd or notable individual that one person or group is responsible for some problem facing the target. The target becomes hostile to the scapegoat until convinced of their innocence (Presence 17). *“They’ve blamed you for the crime, and everyone has bought the lie.”*
