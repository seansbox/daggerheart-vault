### Swashbuckler - Passive

Any incoming damage below 14 causes the attacker to mark a Stress. *“You begin to realize: you might not win this fight.”*

### Reinforcements - Action

Mark a Stress to summon a Pirate Raiders Horde that enters at Far range. This can only be done once per scene. *“The captain whistles, and more pirates pour out from the ship’s hold.”*

### No Quarter - Action

Spend a Fear to choose a target who has more than two pirates within melee range of them. The Captain leads the pirates in hurling threats and promises of a watery grave. The target must make a Presence Reaction Roll or suffer 1d4+1 Stress. They still mark a Stress on a success. *“This is a battle of blades and of insults, it seems.”*
