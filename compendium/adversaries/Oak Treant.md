### Acorn Barrage - Action

Mark a Stress and make an attack against up to three targets within Close range, pummeling them with giant acorns. Each target hit by the attack takes 2d10+5 physical damage. *“The treant hurls its giant acorns in a circular spray.”*

### Just a Tree Oak - Passive

When Hidden, Oak Treant is indistinguishable from other trees around them until they next act or are identified by a roll with Instinct (17). *“It looks like any other tree.”*

### Take Root - Action

Mark a Stress to have this adversary settle into place and extend its roots. Any physical damage Treant takes while rooted is reduced by 8. Treant is Restrained while rooted but may still attack, and can end its rooted state when it activates. *“The treant settles in, roots digging into the ground and bracing.”*
