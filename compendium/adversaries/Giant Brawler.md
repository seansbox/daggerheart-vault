### Bloody Reprisal - Reaction

When the Giant Brawler marks two or more HP, immediately make a Warhammer attack against the attacker, if they are within range. On a success, the target takes 2d6+15 phy damage. *“As soon as your blow has landed, they swing their hammer down at you in response.”*

### Battering Ram - Action

Mark a Stress to have this adversary charge at an inanimate object within Close range they could feasibly smash (a wall, a cart, a market stand, etc.) and destroy it. Any targets in Very Close range of the object must make an Agility Reaction Roll (16) or take 2d4+3 phy damage from the shrapnel. *“The giant charges, shattering everything in their way.”*
