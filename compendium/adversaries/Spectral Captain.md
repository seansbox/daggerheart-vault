### Ghost - Passive

Spectral Captain has resistance to physical damage and may mark a Stress to move a Close distance through solid objects (walls, people, etc.). *“Their translucent form passes through solid objects like a hand through water.”*

### Hold Fast - Reaction

When Spectral allies are forced to make a Reaction roll, mark Stress to give all of them a +2 modifier on that roll. *“The captain bolsters their troops with words, helping them weather your attacks.”*

### Unending Battle - Action

Spend a Fear to return up to 1d4+1 ‘killed’ Spectral allies to the battle in the location where they first appeared. They have all Stress/HP cleared. *“The commander calls for reinforcements, and the same ghosts you’ve already defeated re-appear without a scratch on them.”*
