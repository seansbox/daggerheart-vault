### Relentless (3) - Passive

This adversary may activate three times in a GM move (still requires three action tokens). *“The Warlord fights with the indomitable will, reminding you that they were, in fact, a god.”*

### Doombringer - Reaction

When a PC marks HP from an attack by Undefeated Champion, all characters within Far range of the target lose Hope. *“Every blow that lands saps your will to fight, proof of the warlord’s superiority.”*

### Faltering Armor - Passive

Any time Undefeated Champion takes damage, reduce that damage by 1d10. *“Though damaged, the armor still weakens your blows.”*

### Shattering Strike - Action

Mark a Stress to make a Heart-Shattering Sword attack against every target within Very Close range. Targets hit by this attack lose Hope equal to the HP marked from the damage. *“The Fallen’s sword cleaves through body and spirit.”*

### Endless Legions - Action

Spend a Fear to summon a number of Fallen Shock Troops equal to twice the number of players. They appear at Far range. *“The Warlord blows a twisted horn, and their followers answer, swarming the field.”*

### Circle of Defilement - Reaction

Countdown (2d4) Activate when a hostile creature is spotted. This ticks down every time a token is placed on the action tracker. When triggered, activate a magical circle covering any area within Far range. All opponents within the area are now Vulnerable. This circle can be removed by completing a Progress Countdown (6) with a difficulty of 22. *“The Warlord carves a burning circle of magic in the ground, weakening any foes that step inside.”*
