### Relentless (2) - Passive

This adversary may activate twice in a GM move. *“They move with incredible speed.”*

### Sunsear Arrows - Passive

Targets damaged by Sunsear Shortbow give off bright light within a Close distance until the end of the scene and cannot become Hidden without a magical effect. All attack rolls against a target glowing this way are made with advantage. 

### Crown of Serpents - Attack

Make an attack roll against a target in melee range using this adversary’s protective snakes. On a success, mark stress to deal 2d10+4 phy damage to the target, who must also mark a Stress. 

### Petrifying Gaze - Reaction

Spend a Fear when the Gorgon takes damage from an attack within Close range to force the attacker to make a Reaction roll with Instinct (15). On a failure, they begin to turn to stone, marking 1 hit point of direct damage and starting a petrification Countdown (4). This countdown ticks down every time the Gorgon is attacked. When triggered, the target must make a death move. If the Gorgon is killed, all Petrification countdowns end.
