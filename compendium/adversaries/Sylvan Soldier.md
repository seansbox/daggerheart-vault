### Pack Tactics - Passive

When making a Scythe attack, if another Sylvan Soldier is also in melee range of the target, deal 2d8+5 phy damage instead. *“When they work in packs, they’re more bold, more vicious.”*

### Forest Control - Action

Spend a Fear to pull down a tree within Close range. Anyone the tree might hit on its way down must make an Agility Reaction (15) or take 3d4+11 phy damage. *“They extend vines from their hands and pull the tree down with a crash.”*

### Blend In - Reaction

After a successful attack, mark a Stress to become Hidden until this adversary’s next attack or a PC makes an Instinct Roll (14) to find them. *“When you look up from the attack, they are gone…”*
