### In Your Face - Passive

All enemies in melee range of the swarm of rats have disadvantage on against any target other than the horde. *“They swarm you, pulling your focus from anything but them.”*

### Horde (1d4+2) - Action

Once 4 HP are marked on the horde, they only do 1d4+2 on their Claws attack. *“With their numbers dwindling, they don’t pose as much of a threat.”*
