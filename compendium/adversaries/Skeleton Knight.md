### Cut to the Bone - Action

Mark a Stress to make a Rusty Greatsword attack against all enemies within Very Close range. Each target this succeeds against takes 2d8+5 phy and marks a Stress. *“They swing their sword around them with unexpected power.”*

### Dig Two Graves - Reaction

When this adversary is killed, before it dies, it makes an attack against an enemy within Very Close range (prioritizing the enemy that killed it). On success, the target takes 3d4+8 phy damage and loses 1d4 Hope. *“With its last moment of strength, the bone knight strikes out at you.”*
