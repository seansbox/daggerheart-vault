### High Tide - Passive

On a successful Crashing Wave attack, mark a Stress to also knock the target back to Close range. *“The elemental knocks you back with the force of a living wave.”*

### Waterlog - Action

Mark a Stress to attack a Very Close target with a jet of water. On a success, deal 2d4+7 phy and their next action has disadvantage. On a failure, the target must mark a Stress. *“The elemental’s attack drenches you, clothes and armor and all, slowing you down.”*

### Drowning Embrace - Action

Spend a Fear to make an attack against all targets within Very Close range. Any targets hit by the attack become Restrained and Vulnerable as they begin drowning. The target may end this condition with a Strength or Instinct (17) roll. *“The elemental grabs you and pulls you down with the force of a riptide.”*
