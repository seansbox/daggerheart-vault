### Slow (2) - Passive

The GM must spend two tokens to activate this adversary. *“They take a moment to react, and you can tell they’re not as quick as you are.”*

### Acidic Form - Passive

Any successful melee attacks this creature makes also marks an Armor Slot on the target. This doesn’t reduce any damage. *“The residue eats away at your armor, corroding it slowly.”*

### Envelop - Action

Make an attack against a target in melee. On a success, envelop them, immediately dealing 2 Stress. Every time an action token is placed on the tracker, deal an additional Stress. They will break free the next time the ooze takes Severe damage. *“The ooze encircles you, drawing you into its gelatinous form.”*

### Split - Reaction

When this adversary marks its 3rd Hit Point, spend a Fear to split it into two Tiny Green Oozes (with no marked Hit Points or Stress). They may immediately activate without spending tokens. *“You watch as the damage you’ve done splits it in half… becoming two oozes instead of one.”*
