### The Root of Villainy - Action

Spend a Fear to activate any 2 Emotion Demons within Far range, even if they have activated this GM move. *“The Demon cheers on their allies, hubris driving each of them to greater feats.”*

### You Pale In Comparison - Reaction

Whenever a character fails a roll within Close distance of Demon of Hubris, they mark a Stress. *“The demon taunts you for your inadequacy, critiquing your form with cruel precision.”*

### Double or Nothing - Passive
