### Chevalier - Passive

Knight of the Realm has +2 difficulty when mounted. If they suffer Severe damage, they’re knocked from their mount and lose this benefit until they spend an action to re-mount. *“They’re a skilled rider and know how to use the mount’s speed and strength.”*

### Heavily Armored - Passive

When the Knight of the Realm marks physical damage, reduce it by 3. *“Their heavy armor diminishes the strength of your blows.”*

### Cavalry Charge - Action

If mounted, move up to a close distance and make an attack against a target within very close distance. On a success, deal 2d8+12 phy damage and the target marks Stress. *“They bear down on you, lance seeking your heart as the steed thunders forward.”*

### For the Realm! - Action (2)

Mark a Stress to activate 1d4+1 allies. Any attacks they make in these activations deal half damage. *“Their voice rings loud and clear, and their soldiers follow with vigor.”*
