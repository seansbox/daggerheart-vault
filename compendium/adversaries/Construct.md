### Shifting Amalgamation - Passive

Physical damage dealt to the Construct does +1 Hit Points. *“The creature’s shifting form is vulnerable to the bolts of your crossbow.”*

### Overload - Reaction

Mark a Stress to add +10 to a damage roll this adversary makes. Construct may then activate again. *“The construct swells with arcane energy, powering itself up.”*

### Trample - Action

When this adversary moves during an activation, mark a Stress to make an attack against all targets in its path. On a success, deal 2d6+5 physical damage. *“They run towards you with reckless abandon, stomping everything in their path.”*

### Death Quake - Reaction

When this creature marks its last Hit Point, the magic powering it ruptures in an explosion of force. Make an attack against all targets within Very Close range with advantage. On a success, deal 2d4+8 magic damage. *“As it falls, the magic within ruptures and explodes.”*
