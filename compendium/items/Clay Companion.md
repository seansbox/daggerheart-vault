# Clay Companion

This ball of clay can be sculpted into various animal shapes and will then behave as that animal (a clay spider can spin clay webs, a clay bird can fly). This companion has continuity of memory and self across different shapes but may adopt some mannerisms with each form.

**Number**: `48`
