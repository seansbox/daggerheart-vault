# Action Rolls

Call for an Action Roll when a character takes an action where the outcome is in question and the success or failure is interesting to the story.

1. Pick a character trait.
2. Decide on a difficulty. 
3. Establish the stakes of the roll with the player.
4. Assign advantage or disadvantage if applicable.
5. Tell the player to roll the duality dice.
6. Resolve the situation based on the result of their roll.

## Action Roll Results

- **Critical Success:** They get what they wanted and a little extra. They clear a Stress and gain a Hope.
- **Success with Hope:** They get what they wanted and they gain a Hope.
- **Success with Fear:** They get what they wanted but there is a consequence.
- **Failure with Hope:** They don’t get what they wanted and there is a consequence, but they gain a Hope.
- **Failure with Fear:** They don’t get what they wanted and things go very badly.

## Example GM Moves

- Show how the world reacts. *“The kick shatters the door. Light spills in from the barracks as a half-dozen sleepy soldiers stumble to their feet, looking worried.”*
- Ask a question or build on the answer. *“How is it that you notice the assassin lurking in the treetops?”*
- Make an NPC act in accordance with their motive. *“She claps you on the back and laughs, saying ‘That’s the kind of bravery I like to see from my friends. Here, let’s get another drink!’”*
- Lean on the character’s goals to drive them to action. *“The governor’s husband lies groggy on the altar as the cultists continue to chant. The ritual is coming to a climax earlier than expected. What do you do?”*
- Signal an imminent off-screen threat. *“You hear the crashing of falling trees and shattered branches as thundering steps approach. What do you do?”*
- Reveal an unwelcome truth or unexpected danger. *“He reaches into his cloak and produces the Orb of Vengeance as you realize that he was the necromancer the entire time.”*
- Offer the PCs what they want in exchange for Stress. *“You can pull the baron to safety if you mark 1 Stress, otherwise you can only get yourself out of the way. What do you do?”*
- On a roll with Fear, gain a Fear and describe how the scene’s mood shifts. *“The assassin gives you a knowing smirk as they slip their blade into their waistband and slink into the shadows– the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. What are they planning?”*
- Force the group to split up. *“The elementals are scattering, two heading for the town, three bearing down on the mill. What do you do?”*
- Show the cost of collateral damage. *“The Minotaur barrels into the street, shattering a vegetable cart, sending cabbages flying and knocking the merchant into the wall.”*
- Make a character mark a Stress as a consequence for their actions. *“You hold the door shut, but the skeleton knight is stronger than expected. You summon all your might to keep them at bay, but you can’t keep this up for long. Mark Stress.”*
- Make an attack. *“The spellblade raises their lightning-tinged sword and charges, slicing and stabbing at you with incredible speed.”*
- Spend Action Tokens to activate an adversary or environment. *“I’m going to spend two tokens for a Group Attack. All five zombies shamble forward and converge on you, their stench overpowering as they close in.”*
- Capture someone or something important. *“The thief slides past you and jumps into the cart, grabbing the idol from the seat and stuffing it into their pouch.”*
- Use a character’s backstory against them. *“Your mentor sighs, drawing their blade. ‘I wish it didn’t come to this, child. But you still don’t understand what sacrifices are required to maintain the peace.’”*
- Take away an opportunity permanently. *“The door slams shut, cutting you off from the vault as the temple continues to collapse.”*
