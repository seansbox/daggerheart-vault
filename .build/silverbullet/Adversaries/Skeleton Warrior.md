## Only Bones - Passive
This creature is resistant to physical damage. _“Your weapon slides through their ribs, no skin to pierce. ”_

## Won’t Stay Dead - Reaction
After this adversary has marked its last hit point, you may still activate it to roll 1d6. On a 6, if there are any other adversaries still on the battlefield, this adversary reforms itself and returns to battle with no hit points marked. _“The pile of bones reforms itself, rising up to fight again.”_
