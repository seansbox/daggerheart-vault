## Searing Glance - Reaction
Mark a Stress when a character within Close distance makes a roll with Presence. The target must make a Presence Reaction Roll (16). If they fail, they mark 2 Stress and are Vulnerable for the remainder of the scene until they succeed on a social action against the Courtesan. If they succeed, they still mark Stress. _“Just as you make your point, they tear you apart with a tiny scoff.”_

## Dangerous Allure - Action
Spend a Fear to subvert a character, convincing them to do something they want to do even if they know it’s a bad idea. If used on an NPC, it just works unless it would violate their motive. If used on a PC, the PC must make a React roll with Presence (16). If they fail, they can do as the Courtesan asks or mark 2 Stress. If they succeed, they still mark Stress. This subversion is often, but not always, romantic or physical.
