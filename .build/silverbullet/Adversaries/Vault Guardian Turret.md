## Slow (2) - Passive
It takes 2 action tokens to activate this adversary. _“They move slowly, having a hard time keeping up with you.”_

## Concentrate Fire - Action
Mark a Stress when another adversary does damage to a target within Far range of the Turret to add the Turret’s damage to the total. _“The Turret locks on to their ally’s attack and pours on supporting fire.”_

## Mark Target - Action
Spend a Fear to mark a target within Far range. The marked target’s Evasion is halved. Removed Marked if the Turret is destroyed or the Marked target becomes Hidden. _“The Turret beeps and you feel a presence watching you as if from all sides.”_

## Detonation - Reaction
When this adversary is destroyed, it explodes to deal 3d20 magic damage to all targets within Very Close range. Targets may make a reaction roll with Agility (17) to take half damage. If they roll a critical success, they take no damage. _“The turret slums, then a beeping starts and increases in pace before the whole thing explodes in a burst of ancient magic.”_
