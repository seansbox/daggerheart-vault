On a success, deal 2d10+10mag damage. 2. Fire Jets The cube shoots into the air, spinning as it releases jets of flame. Make an attack against all targets within Close range. Any you succeed against take 2d6+3 phy damage. 3. Trample The cube rockets around a Close area, attacking all within. Any it is successful against take 2d8+10 physical damage and are Vulnerable until their next roll with Hope. 4. Shocking Gas The cube sprays out a silver gas sparking with lightning. All creatures within Close range must make a Finesse Reaction Roll (15) or mark 3 Stress. 5. Stunning Clap The cube leaps and its sides clap, creating a small sonic boom. Any targets within Very Close range must make a Strength Reaction Roll or become Vulnerable until this adversary is defeated. 6. Psionic Whine The cube releases a cluster of mechanical bees whose buzz rattles mortal minds. All targets within Close range must make a Presence Reaction Roll (15) or take 2d8+10 mag damage that can’t be reduced by armor. _“The box jumps and spins, and unleashes a different attack depending on the side that landed face-up.”_

## Death Quake
When this adversary marks its last Hit Point, the magic powering it ruptures in an explosion of force. All targets in Close range make an Instinct Reaction Roll or take 2d8+12 magic damage.
