## Money Talks - Passive
All attacks against Demon of Greed are made at disadvantage unless the attacker spends a handful of gold. When a character marks HP from an attack by Demon of Avarice, they can spend a bag of gold instead of marking HP (1 bag per HP). Add a gold token to Demon of Avarice for each handful or bag of gold spent by PCs on this feature. _“The demon taunts you, saying that you must pay for the privilege of fighting it on fair terms.”_

## Number Must Go Up - Passive
Always add a bonus to Demon of Greed’s attacks equal to the number of gold tokens it has. _“As it accumulates wealth, the demon’s attacks are becoming more powerful.”_

## Money Is Time - Action
Spend 3 gold tokens (or a Fear) to activate 1d4+1 allies, including allies that have already activated this GM turn. _“Some of the demon’s gold disintegrates and their allies leap into action.”_
