## Armor Shredding Shards - Passive
Any successful melee attacks against this creature also mark an armor slot on the attacker. _“Though the strike hits true, its glass scales shred your armor.”_

## Spinning Serpent - Action
Mark a Stress to make an attack against all targets within Very Close range. Any target hit takes 1d8+5 phy damage. _“It spins violently, its sharp body striking in every direction.”_

## Spitter - Action
Spend a Fear to introduce a Spitter d6 die. Anytime the Glass Snake activates, roll this die. On a 5+, all targets in front of the snake within Far range must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or take 2d6+3 damage. This does not use the snake’s activation. _“Hundreds of shards of pearlescent glass spiral towards you.”_
