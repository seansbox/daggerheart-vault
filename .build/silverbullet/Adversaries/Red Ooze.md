## Creeping Fire - Action
This adversary can only move Very Close range when it activates. It lights any flammable object it touches on fire. _“It creeps towards you, the ground around it erupting into flames.”_

## Ignite - Action
Make an attack against a target in Very Close range. On a success, they burst into flames, taking 1d8+1 mag damage immediately and 2d4+2 direct magic damage every time a token is placed on the action tracker. This ends when they are extinguished with a Finesse Roll (14). _“You feel fire at your feet, and suddenly, you’re engulfed.”_

## Split - Reaction
When this adversary marks its 3rd Hit Point, spend a Fear to split it into two Tiny Red Oozes (with no marked Hit Points or Stress). They may immediately activate without spending tokens. _“You watch as the damage you’ve done splits it in half… becoming two oozes instead of one.”_
