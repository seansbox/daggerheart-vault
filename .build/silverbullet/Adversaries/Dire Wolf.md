## Pack Tactics - Passive
When making a Claws attack, if another Dire Wolf is also in melee range of the target, deal 2d6+8 phy damage instead. _“When they work in packs, they’re more bold, more vicious.”_

## Hobbling Strike - Action
Make an attack against a target in melee range. On a success, mark a Stress to deal 3d4+10 phy damage and make them Vulnerable until they heal a Hit Point. _“With a snarl, they lunge at you, sinking their teeth in deep.”_
