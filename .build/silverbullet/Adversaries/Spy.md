## Fly on the Wall - Reaction
Mark a Stress when something sensitive is discussed to reveal that the Spy is present in a scene observing a character or group. The PC with the highest Instinct or best chance to notice the Spy makes an Instinct Reaction Roll (17) to notice the Spy. If they fail, they can mark Stress to know that they’re being observed but not where the Spy is. 

## Gathering Secrets - Action
Spend a Fear to describe how the Spy knows a secret about a target character in the scene. If the target is a PC, they may mark 2 Stress to suggest a lesser secret that the Spy learned instead.
