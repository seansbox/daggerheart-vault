## Destructible - Passive
Whenever Patchwork Zombie takes Major damage or worse, it marks +1 HP. _“Your blows land harder than expected, limbs and torsos falling from the creature.”_

## Flailing Limbs - Passive
When Patchwork Zombie Hulk makes an attack, it targets all opponents within Very Close range. _“It attacks in every direction, torso-sized limbs flailing.”_

## Another For The Pile - Action
If the Patchwork Zombie Hulk is within Very Close of a corpse, it presses the cadaver to itself and incorporates it into the Hulk’s form, healing 1 HP and clearing 1 Stress. _“The hulk grabs the dead and swallows them, replacing some of its wounds and growing more energetic.”_

## Tormented Screams - Action
Mark Stress to cause all PCs within Far range to make a reaction roll (Presence 13) or lose a Hope and add a token to the action tracker. PCs that succeed mark Stress instead.
