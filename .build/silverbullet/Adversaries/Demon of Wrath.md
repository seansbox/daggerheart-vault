## Anger Unrelenting - Passive
When a character marks armor to reduce damage from Demon of Wrath’s attacks, their armor is only half as effective. _“The demons’ fury powers their blows, tearing through your armor..”_

## Retaliation - Reaction
Mark Stress when Demon of Wrath takes damage from a target within Close damage to make an immediate basic attack against them. _“Incensed by your blow, the demon slashes back at you.”_

## Battle Lust - Action
Spend a Fear to boil the blood of all targets within a Far range. For the rest of the scene, they use a d20 as their Fear die instead of a d12. _“The demon roars, and something within your heart answers. You feel the pull to fight, to kill. That anger threatens to overtake you.”_

## Blood and Souls - Reaction
Countdown (Loop 6) Activate this countdown the first time an attack is made within sight of the Demon of Wrath. This Countdown only reduces when a PC takes a violent action. When triggered, Summon 1d4 Minor Demons that are drawn to the carnage. They appear at a Close distance. _“Lesser demons are drawn to the carnage, forming out of blood shed on the battlefield.”_
