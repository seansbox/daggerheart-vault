## Relentless (3) - Passive
This adversary may activate three times in a GM move (still requires three action tokens). _“The Warlord fights with the indomitable will, reminding you that they were, in fact, a god.”_

## Doombringer - Reaction
When a PC marks HP from an attack by Undefeated Champion, all characters within Far range of the target lose Hope. _“Every blow that lands saps your will to fight, proof of the warlord’s superiority.”_

## Faltering Armor - Passive
Any time Undefeated Champion takes damage, reduce that damage by 1d10. _“Though damaged, the armor still weakens your blows.”_

## Shattering Strike - Action
Mark a Stress to make a Heart-Shattering Sword attack against every target within Very Close range. Targets hit by this attack lose Hope equal to the HP marked from the damage. _“The Fallen’s sword cleaves through body and spirit.”_

## Endless Legions - Action
Spend a Fear to summon a number of Fallen Shock Troops equal to twice the number of players. They appear at Far range. _“The Warlord blows a twisted horn, and their followers answer, swarming the field.”_

## Circle of Defilement - Reaction
Countdown (2d4) Activate when a hostile creature is spotted. This ticks down every time a token is placed on the action tracker. When triggered, activate a magical circle covering any area within Far range. All opponents within the area are now Vulnerable. This circle can be removed by completing a Progress Countdown (6) with a difficulty of 22. _“The Warlord carves a burning circle of magic in the ground, weakening any foes that step inside.”_
