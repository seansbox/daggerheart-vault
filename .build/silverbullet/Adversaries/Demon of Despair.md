## Depths of Despair - Passive
Demon of Despair deals double damage to a PC with 0 Hope. _“Bereft of hope, the demon's blows cut you to the quick.”_

## Your Friends Will Fail You - Reaction
When a PC fails with Fear, mark Stress to cause all other PCs within a Close distance to lose a Hope. _“The demon’s voice echoes in your ears, pushing you to doubt your comrades.”_

## Your Struggle Is Pointless - Action
Spend a Fear to weigh down the spirits of all within a Far range. All targets affected replace their Hope die with a d8 until they roll a success with Hope or take a rest. _“The demon’s miasma fills your senses, choking your heart. Your chances of victory seem much dimmer.”_
