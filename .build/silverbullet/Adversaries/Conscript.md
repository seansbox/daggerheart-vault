## Minion (6) - Passive
This adversary is defeated if they take any damage. For every 6 damage a PC deals to this adversary, defeat an additional minion in the attack’s range. _“You cut through them effortlessly, one to the next.”_

## Group Attack - Action (2)
Choose a target and activate all Conscripts within Close range of them. Those minions move into melee with the target and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they deal 5 phy damage each. Combine this damage together. _“They descend on you, stronger together.”_
