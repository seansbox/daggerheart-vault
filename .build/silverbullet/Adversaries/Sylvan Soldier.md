## Pack Tactics - Passive
When making a Scythe attack, if another Sylvan Soldier is also in melee range of the target, deal 2d8+5 phy damage instead. _“When they work in packs, they’re more bold, more vicious.”_

## Forest Control - Action
Spend a Fear to pull down a tree within Close range. Anyone the tree might hit on its way down must make an Agility Reaction (15) or take 3d4+11 phy damage. _“They extend vines from their hands and pull the tree down with a crash.”_

## Blend In - Reaction
After a successful attack, mark a Stress to become Hidden until this adversary’s next attack or a PC makes an Instinct Roll (14) to find them. _“When you look up from the attack, they are gone…”_
