## Slow (2) - Passive
This adversary costs 2 action tokens to activate. _“The enemy moves slowly, but with incredible strength.”_

## Charging Bull - Action
Spend a Fear to make an attack roll on a group within Very Close range. The Minotaur charges through them, making an attack. Any they succeed against are knocked back to Close range and take 2d10+10 phy damage. If they are knocked into a solid object or another creature, they take an additional 1d8+3 phy (add the damage together). _“The Minotaur lowers their head and charges, knocking you back with incredible force.”_

## Gore - Action
Make an attack against a target within Very Close range, moving the Minotaur into melee with them. On a success, deal 2d6+15 phy damage to the target. Armor is only worth half its value against this attack. _“The Minotaur slashes and stabs with their huge horns, punching through your armor.”_
