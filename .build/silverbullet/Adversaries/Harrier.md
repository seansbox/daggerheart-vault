## Maintain Distance - Passive
After making an attack, Harrier may move anywhere within Far range. _“They move with purpose across the battlefield, away from the fray.”_

## Fall Back - Reaction
When a PC moves into melee to make an attack, Harrier may mark a Stress before the attack roll to move anywhere within Close range and make a Javelin attack on them. A success deals 1d8+7 phy damage. _“They won’t let you get close, instead turning an attack back on you.”_
