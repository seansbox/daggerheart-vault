## Casus Belli - Reaction
Countdown (8) Spend a Fear to activate after the Monarch’s desire for war is first revealed. When triggered, the Monarch has created or found justification sufficient to rally the nation to war. 

## Execute Them! - Action
Mark a Stress per PC in the party (If the Monarch does not have enough Stress for the entire party, mark half their remaining Stress and spend a Fear) to have the group condemned for crimes real or imagined. A character may roll with Presence (16) to demand trial by combat or another special form of trial. 

## Crownsguard - Action
Once per scene, mark a Stress to summon a group of Tier II guards to enforce the Monarch’s will. They appear at a Close distance.
