## Bone Breaker - Passive
When a PC uses an Armor Slot to reduce incoming damage from the Cave Ogre, it is only half as effective. _“The ogre can shatter armor as easily as break bones.”_

## Rampaging Fury - Reaction
When this creature takes Major or Severe Damage, they rampage. Move them to somewhere within Close range and deal 2d6+3 direct physical damage to anyone they would cross through to get there. _“Enraged by your attack, the enemy charges forward.”_

## Hail of Boulders - Action (2)
Mark a Stress to pick up heavy objects and throw them at all targets in front of the ogre up to Far range. Make an attack roll against these targets. Any you succeed against take 3d4+12 phy damage. _“A boulder flies towards you, too large and too fast to run from.”_
