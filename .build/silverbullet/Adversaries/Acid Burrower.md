## Relentless (2) - Passive
This adversary may activate twice in a GM move. _“They move with incredible speed.”_

## Earth Eruption - Action
Mark a Stress to have this adversary burst out of the ground, causing anyone within Very Close to make an Agility (14) reaction roll or be knocked over and Vulnerable until they next act. _“They burrow themselves deep and explode out from under you.”_

## Spit Acid - Action
Make an attack against all targets in front of the Acid Burrower within Close range. On a success, deal 2d6+3 phy damage and make their armor score is halved until the next time they repair it. _“The acid starts to eat away at your armor.”_

## Acid Bath - Reaction
When this adversary takes Severe damage, all targets within Close range are bathed in its acidic blood, dealing 2d8+5 phy damage (armor is half as effective against this damage). This splash covers the ground within a Very Close distance with acid blood, and any movement through it by another creature automatically deals 1d6 damage. _“As you strike them, you’re covered in their cold, corrosive blood.”_
