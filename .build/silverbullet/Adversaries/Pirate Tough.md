## Swashbuckler - Passive
Any incoming damage below 15 causes the attacker to mark a Stress. _“You begin to realize: you might not win this fight.”_

## Clear The Decks - Action
Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, mark a Stress to move into melee with them and deal 2d6+10 damage. The target is then thrown back to a Close distance. _“The ship rocks, sending you sprawling.”_
