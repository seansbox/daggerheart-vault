## Relentless (3) - Passive
This adversary may activate three times in a GM move. _“The dragon moves with liquid grace, lava-coated claws searing the air.”_

## Shattering Might - Action
Mark a Stress to attack a target within Very Close range. If successful, it deals 4d8+20 phy damage. Creatures hit by Shattering Might are knocked away to Close range and add a token to the action tracker. _“The dragon’s blow tears into you, stunning you for a moment before you shake it off to rejoin the fight.”_

## Volcanic Breath - Reaction
Any time this adversary is dealt Major damage, roll 1d10. On an 8+, this creature breathes a flow of lava on all targets in front of them within Far range. They must make an Agility Reaction Roll (20). On a failure, they take 2d20+12 phy damage, mark 1d4 Stress, and are Vulnerable until they clear a Stress. On a success, they take half damage and mark 1 Stress. _“The dragon retaliates with a fountain of lava breath that cooks you within your armor.”_

## Eruption - Action
Spend a Fear to erupt lava from beneath this adversary’s scales, filling the area in Very Close range around them with molten lava. Any targets in that area must make an Agility Reaction Roll (20) or take 4d6+8 phy damage and be pushed out into Close range. This area remains lava that deals 4d6+8 damage to anyone who enters it until the battle is over. _“The dragon erupts like a living volcano, rivers of lava splashing and flowing across the battlefield.”_

## Lava Splash - Reaction
Whenever Molten Scourge takes Severe Damage, molten blood gushes forth from the wound dealing 2d10+8 direct phy damage to the attacker if they are within Very Close range. _“The dragon’s blood boils, splashing with unbearable heat and burning you.”_

## Cracked Scales - Reaction
Any time Volcanic Dragon takes damage, it reduces that damage by 1d8. _“Though damaged, the dragon’s scales still blunt some of your attack.”_

## Ashen Vengeance (Phase Change) - Reaction
When Molten Scourge marks their last HP, replace them with Ashen Tyrant. Spend a Fear to have them activate immediately. _“Wounded, the cooling lava hardens and then bursts into a cloud of ash as the dragon reveals their final form.”_
