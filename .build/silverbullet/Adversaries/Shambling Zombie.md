## Too Many to Handle - Passive
If Shambling Zombie is in melee range with an opponent and at least one other Zombie is within Close range, all attacks against that opponent have advantage. _“You no longer know where to look as more zombies surround you.”_

## Horrifying - Passive
When this creature deals hit point damage to a target, the target also marks Stress. _“A cold shiver goes down your spine as you face off against the corpse of someone you knew.”_
