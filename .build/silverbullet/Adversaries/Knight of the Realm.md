## Chevalier - Passive
Knight of the Realm has +2 difficulty when mounted. If they suffer Severe damage, they’re knocked from their mount and lose this benefit until they spend an action to re-mount. _“They’re a skilled rider and know how to use the mount’s speed and strength.”_

## Heavily Armored - Passive
When the Knight of the Realm marks physical damage, reduce it by 3. _“Their heavy armor diminishes the strength of your blows.”_

## Cavalry Charge - Action
If mounted, move up to a close distance and make an attack against a target within very close distance. On a success, deal 2d8+12 phy damage and the target marks Stress. _“They bear down on you, lance seeking your heart as the steed thunders forward.”_

## For the Realm! - Action (2)
Mark a Stress to activate 1d4+1 allies. Any attacks they make in these activations deal half damage. _“Their voice rings loud and clear, and their soldiers follow with vigor.”_
