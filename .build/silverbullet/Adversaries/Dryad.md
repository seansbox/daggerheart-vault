## Bramble Patch
Mark Stress to target a spot within Far range. Create a patch of thorns that covers everywhere within Close range of that spot. All creatures within that area suffer 2d6+2 phy damage whenever they act, and can escape with a Finesse (16) roll or by dealing 20+ damage with an attack. _“The treant sings a short riff, and thorny brambles erupt from the ground.”_

## We Are All One
When another adversary dies within Close range, spend a Fear to clear 2 HP and 2 Stress on this adversary as the fallen ally’s life force is returned to the forest. _“The dryad kneels down and draws the fading life from their ally, rising with eyes filled with tears of grief and rage._

## Grow Saplings
Spend a Fear to grow three Treant Sapling Minions, who appear at Close range and instantly activate. _“The dryad plants seeds, which instantly grow up into animate saplings.”_
