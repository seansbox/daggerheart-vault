## Unyielding - Passive
Zombie Legion has resistance to physical damage. _“Your blows carve flesh like lumber, but they seem to ignore their injuries.”_

## Relentless (2) - Passive
Zombie Legion may activate twice in a GM move (still takes two action tokens). _“The horde keeps coming, never stopping their attack.”_

## Overwhelm - Reaction
When a creature within Melee distance deals damage to Zombie Legion but it does not cause Zombie Legion to mark at least Major damage, mark a Stress to have Zombie Legion immediately make an attack against that creature with advantage. _“The legion surrounds you, two closing in for every one you fell.”_

## Horde (2d6+10) - Passive
If Zombie Legion has half or more of its Hit Points marked, its attack only deals 2d6+10 phy damage. _“Their numbers diminished, the legion doesn’t pose as much of a threat.”_
