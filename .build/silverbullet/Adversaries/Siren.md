## Enchanting Song - Action
Spend a Fear to sing a song that affects all non-Siren creatures within Close distance. Targets must make an Instinct Reaction Roll (14) or become entranced. Other Sirens within a Close range of the target can mark Stress to increase the difficulty of this roll by +1 each. While entranced, a target cannot act and is Vulnerable. A character may mark 2 Stress to free themselves from this effect. _“Their song tugs at your soul, promising an end to all your troubles through sweet oblivion.”_

## Captive Audience - Passive
If Siren attacks a target entranced by their song, the target takes 2d10+10 damage instead of normal damage. _“Incapacitated by the song, the Siren tears into you with incredible ferocity.”_
