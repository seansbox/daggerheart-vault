## Opportunist - Passive
When two or more adversaries are very close to a target, all damage the archer deals to them is doubled. _“Seeing their opportunity, they pull back and let loose an arrow.”_

## Deadly Shot - Action
Make an attack against a Vulnerable target within Far range. On a success, mark a Stress to deal 3d4+8 damage. _“Their arrow finds you, exploiting your vulnerability to sink itself deep.”_
