## Relentless (2) - Passive
This adversary may activate two times in a GM move. _“The dragon presses the attack, hounding you like prey.”_

## Flying - Passive
Attack rolls against this creature while it is flying are at +3 difficulty. _“They take to the sky, great wings slicing through the air.”_

## Avalanche Tail - Action
Mark a Stress to make a tail attack against all targets within Close range. Any hit by Avalanche Tail take 4d6+8 phy damage and are knocked back to Close range, becoming Vulnerable until their next roll with Hope. _“The dragon spins, obsidian tail coming down on you like a rockslide.”_

## Divebomb - Action
If this adversary is flying, mark a Stress to pick a spot within Far range. Make an attack against all targets within Very Close range of that spot. Any you succeed against take 2d10+12 phy damage. Targets hit by Divebomb also mark a Stress and lose a Hope. _“The dragon’s wings fold in as it dives, crashing down with their entire weight.”_

## Obsidian Scales - Reaction
Any time Obsidian Predator takes damage, it reduces that damage by 2d8. _“Your blows crack and chip the obsidian plates, but do not dig as deep as you’d hoped.”_

## Erupting Rage (Phase Change) - Reaction
When Obsidian Predator marks their last HP, replace them with Molten Scourge. Spend a Fear to have them activate immediately. _“Incandescent with rage, the dragon’s scales burst into molten lava.”_
