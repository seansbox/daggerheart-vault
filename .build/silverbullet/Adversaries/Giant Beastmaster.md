## Pinning Strike - Action
Make a Longbow attack against a target. On a success, the Beastmaster may also mark a Stress to pin them to a nearby surface. A pinned target is Restrained until freed with a Finesse or Strength Roll (16). _“Their arrow punches through you and pins you to the nearby terrain.”_

## Deadly Companion - Action
Up to twice per scene, summon a Bear, Dire Wolf, or similar Tier 0 Beast under this adversary’s control. That beast appears at a Close range and immediately activates. _“They blow a whistle and a trained beast emerges, charging forward at the giant’s command.”_

## Two as One - Passive
When this adversary activates, you can also activate a Tier 0 Beast currently under this adversary’s control. _“The beast and giant move in perfect sync, closing in together.”_
