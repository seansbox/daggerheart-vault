## Encumber - Reaction
Whenever Tangle Bramble Swarm hits a PC, give them a bramble token. If a creature has any bramble tokens when they activate, they add an additional token to the action tracker when they take an action. If a creature has 3 or more bramble tokens, they are Restrained. Bramble tokens can be removed by making a Finesse roll (12 + the number of bramble tokens) or dealing Major damage to Tangle Bramble Swarm. If removed without damage, create a Tangle Bramble Minion in Melee with the now-freed character for each token removed. _“The brambles grab a hold of you, digging in and slowing your movement.”_

## Crush - Action
Mark Stress to deal 2d6+8 phy direct damage to a target with 3 or more bramble tokens. _“The brambles dig into you, blood draining into the vegetable matter.”_

## Horde 1d4+2 - Passive
If Tangle Brambles has 3 or more of their Hit Points marked, their attack only deals 1d4+2 damage. _“With their numbers dwindling, they don’t pose as much of a threat.”_
