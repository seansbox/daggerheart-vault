## Won’t See It Coming - Passive
Armor is half as effective against attacks made while Master Assassin is Hidden. _“Attacking from stealth, their attack finds the gaps in your armor.”_

## Strike as One - Action
Mark a Stress to activate a number of Assassins equal to the Master Assassin’s unmarked Stress. _“Their leader whistles, and a group of assassins act as one with practiced grace.”_

## The Subtle Blade - Reaction
When Master Assassin successfully makes a Serrated Dagger attack against a character that is Vulnerable, spend a Fear to deal 3 Hit Points instead of rolling. _“Their eyes go black as the attack comes in, and the blade appears in your side, stabbing deep and ignoring your armor.”_
