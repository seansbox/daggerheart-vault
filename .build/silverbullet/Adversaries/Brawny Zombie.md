## Slow (2) - Passive
It takes 2 action tokens to activate this adversary. _“A lumbering figure moves towards you in the darkness.”_

## Rip & Tear - Reaction
On a successful attack in melee, mark a Stress to make the target Restrained and force them to mark 2 Stress (in addition to normal damage). _“The zombie grabs you and holds fast. You need to escape before it tears you apart.”_

## Rend Asunder - Action
When the Brawny Zombie has a target Restrained, make an attack with advantage. On a success, armor cannot be used against this damage. _“The zombie pulls on your limbs, trying to tear you apart like an angry child with a doll.”_
