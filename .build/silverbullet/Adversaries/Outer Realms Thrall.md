## Minion (13) - Passive
This adversary is defeated if they take any damage. For every 13 damage a PC deals to this adversary, defeat an additional minion in the attack’s range. _“You cut through them effortlessly, one to the next.”_

## Group Attack - Action
Choose a target and activate all Outer Realm Thralls within Close range of them. Those minions move into melee with the target and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they deal 11 phy damage each. Combine this damage together. _“They descend on you, stronger together.”_
