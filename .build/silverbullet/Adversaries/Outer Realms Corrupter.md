## Will-Shattering Touch - Passive
Targets damaged by Outer Realms Corrupter lose a Hope. _“The pseudopod burns your flesh, but worse, it burns your resolve.”_

## Disgorge Reality Flotsam - Action
Mark a Stress to spew partially-digested portions of consumed realities at all targets within Close range. Targets must make a Knowledge Reaction Roll (20). Any that fail mark 2 Stress. _“The creature barfs forth dejecta and effluvia from dead worlds.”_
