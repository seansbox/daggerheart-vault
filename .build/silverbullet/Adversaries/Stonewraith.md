## Stonestrider - Passive
Stonewraith can move through stone and earth as if it was sand/rough terrain. They only need to surface air once every twenty minutes and use Stonesense to identify pockets of air in tunnels and the surface. _“The beast leaps into the stone wall like it was merely sand.”_

## Rocky Ambush - Action
Mark a Stress as Stonewraith leaps from within stone/earth to attack a target. The target must make an Agility or Instinct Reaction Roll (15) or take 2d8+12 phy damage and become temporarily Vulnerable until they take their next action. _“They burst from the wall to tackle you to the floor and rend you with their teeth.”_

## Avalanche Roar - Action
Spend a Fear to roar and cause a cave-in. All targets within Close must make an Agility (14) Reaction Roll or suffer 2d10+10 phy damage. The rubble can be cleared with a Completion Countdown (8). _“Their voice resonates with the stone. The ceiling cracks and comes tumbling down all around you.”_
