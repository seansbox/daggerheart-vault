## Unparalleled Skill - Action
Mark a Stress to make an attack that automatically hits. _“The demon snarls as they push themselves to perfect action, their blow landing with unmatched skill.”_

## The Root of Villainy - Action
Spend a Fear to activate any 2 Emotion Demons within Far range, even if they have activated this GM move. _“The Demon cheers on their allies, hubris driving each of them to greater feats.”_

## You Pale In Comparison - Reaction
Whenever a character fails a roll within Close distance of Demon of Hubris, they mark a Stress. _“The demon taunts you for your inadequacy, critiquing your form with cruel precision.”_

## Double or Nothing - Passive
When a character fails a roll, they may choose to re-roll their Fear die and take the new result. If they fail, they mark 2 Stress and Demon of Hubris clears a Stress. _“The demon’s intensity drives you to perfection, at a terrible cost.”_
