## Minion (13) - Passive
This adversary is defeated if they take any damage. For every 13 damage a PC deals to this adversary, they also deal 1 HP to an additional minion within this attack’s range. _“You cut through them effortlessly, one to the next.”_

## Group Attack - Action
Choose a target and activate every Fallen Shock Troop within Close range of them. Those minions move into melee with the target and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they deal 13 phy damage each. Combine this damage together. _“They descend on you, stronger together.”_

## Aura of Doom - Passive
A character that marks HP from an attack by this adversary also loses Hope. _“The fallen tear into you, wounding your body and spirit alike.”_
