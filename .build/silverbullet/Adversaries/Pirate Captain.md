## Swashbuckler - Passive
Any incoming damage below 14 causes the attacker to mark a Stress. _“You begin to realize: you might not win this fight.”_

## Reinforcements - Action
Mark a Stress to summon a Pirate Raiders Horde that enters at Far range. This can only be done once per scene. _“The captain whistles, and more pirates pour out from the ship’s hold.”_

## No Quarter - Action
Spend a Fear to choose a target who has more than two pirates within melee range of them. The Captain leads the pirates in hurling threats and promises of a watery grave. The target must make a Presence Reaction Roll or suffer 1d4+1 Stress. They still mark a Stress on a success. _“This is a battle of blades and of insults, it seems.”_
