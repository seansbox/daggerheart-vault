## Many-Headed Menace - Passive
Hydra begins with three heads and can have up to five. Each time the Hydra takes Major or higher damage, it loses a head. _“The hydra’s heads are terrifying, but not invulnerable.”_

## Relentless (X) - Passive
Hydra may activate X times per GM move, where X is the Hydra’s number of heads. _“The more heads it has, the more dangerous the hydra becomes.”_

## Regeneration - Action
If the Hydra has any marked HP, spend a Fear to heal 1 HP and grow two heads. _“The stalk of the severed head splits, grows, and becomes two new heads.”_

## Terrifying Chorus - Action (2)
All targets within Far range lose 2 Hope. _“The dissonant screams off the Hydra make your heart sink.”_

## Magical Weakness - Reaction
When the Hydra takes magic damage, they become Dazed. While Dazed, they can’t use Regeneration but are immune to magic damage. The Hydra loses the Dazed condition on any roll with Fear (not including the roll that dealt it the damage that made it Dazed). _“Your magical blow seems to impede the Hydra’s ability to regenerate, but lets it shrug off other magical attacks.”_
