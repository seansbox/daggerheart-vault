## Quick Hands - Action (2)
Make a claw attack against a target in Melee range. On a success, deal 1d8+2 phy damage and this adversary steals one item or consumable from the target’s inventory. _“The Katari swipes at you with their claws, and when their paw comes away, they’ve stolen something from your pouch. They flash you a satisfied smile.”_

## Escape Plan - Action
Mark a Stress to reveal a snare trap set by the Katari Burglar. All targets within Very Close range of the trap must make an Agility Reaction Roll (13) or be pulled off their feet and suspended upside down. They are Vulnerable and Restrained until they get free with a Finesse or Strength Roll (13). _“A snare snaps closed on you and flips you upside down. The Katari gives you a mocking wave as they make their escape.”_
