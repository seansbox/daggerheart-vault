## Flight - Passive
Giant Eagle’s Difficulty is +3 when flying. _“The eagle soars and swoops with incredible agility.”_

## Deadly Dive - Action
Mark Stress to attack a target within Far range. On a success, the target takes 2d10+10 damage and is knocked over, making them Vulnerable until they next act. _“The eagle narrows itself into a feathered javelin, tearing through the sky before opening up and raking you with their claws.”_

## Take Off - Action (2)
Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, the target takes 2d4+3 phy damage and must make an Agility Reaction Roll or become Restrained within the eagle’s massive talons. If they are Restrained, the Eagle immediately lifts into the air to Very Far range above the battlefield while holding them. A Restrained target may make a Strength roll to escape. 

## Deadly Drop - Action
If the Eagle is holding a Restrained target and flying, they can drop them. This means the target is no longer Restrained, but they are falling. If their fall is not prevented by some means on the next action the PCs take, the target will suffer 2d20 phy damage.
