## Our Master’s Will - Reaction
When the GM activates an ally within Far distance, Secret-Keeper may Mark Stress to add a token to the action tracker. _“The Secret-Keeper’s voice carries the weight of dread, chilling your blood.”_

## Seize Your Moment - Action
Spend a Fear to activate 1d4 allies to attack. Their attacks deal half damage. _“When they call, the cultists answer, swarming to attack.”_

## Summoning Ritual - Reaction - Spell
Countdown (6) Activate when a hostile target is spotted. When triggered, summon a Minor Demon within a Close distance. Each time Secret-Keeper marks HP, add the number of HP marked to this Countdown. _“Their leader’s hands glow with eerie light, chanting a ritual of summoning. Whatever they’re calling out to, it’s not good.”_

## Fallen Hounds - Reaction
Once per scene, when Secret-Keeper takes Major or worse damage, mark a Stress to summon a Demonic Hound Pack. They appear at a Close distance and immediately activate (no token required). _“The Secret-Keeper reels from the blow, then throws a sulfurous pouch to the ground. From it springs a pack of monstrous hounds, eager for the hunt.”_
