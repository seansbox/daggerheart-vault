## Fearsome Presence - Passive
The GM gains a Fear whenever a PC rolls with Fear within Very Close distance of Perfected Zombie. They may not select the ‘Gain a Fear’ GM move for this roll result. _“Their very existence undermines your confidence, as death triumphs over life.”_

## Memento Mori - Action
Mark a Stress to make a Greataxe attack against all targets within Very Close Range. Targets damaged by an attack from Perfected Zombie are knocked back to Close range and must mark an armor slot after taking damage. If they can’t, they mark an additional hit point. _“The zombie raises their greataxe and spins, carving through everything in their way.”_

## Skilled Opportunist - Reaction
When another adversary damages a target within Very Close of Perfected Zombie, remove a token from the action tracker to have Perfected Zombie add damage from their Greataxe to that attack. _“They watch the battle with great tactical awareness, taking advantage of openings created by their allies.”_
