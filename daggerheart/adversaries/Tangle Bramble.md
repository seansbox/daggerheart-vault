*Individual blood-drinking tumbleweeds*

- **Motives & Tactics**: Drain, Entangle, Combine
- **Difficulty:** `11` | **Attack Modifier:** `-1` | **Thorns:** `Melee 4 phy`


### Minion (4) - Passive

This adversary is defeated if they take any damage. For every 4 damage a PC deals to this adversary, defeat an additional minion in the attack’s range. *“You cut through them effortlessly, one to the next.”*

### Group Attack - Action (2)

Choose a target and activate all Tangle Brambles within Close range of them. Those minions move into melee with the target and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they deal 4 phy damage each. Combine this damage together. *“They descend on you, stronger together.”*

### Drain & Multiply - Reaction

If an attack from Tangle Brambles deals HP and there are three or more Tangle Bramble Minions in Close range, combine all Tangle Bramble minions into a Tangle Bramble Swarm with HP equal to the number of minions combined.
