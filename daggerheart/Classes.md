# Bard

![[bard.webp|205x256]]

Those who become bards are truly the most charismatic members of all the realms. Members of this class are masters of captivation and may specialize in any of a variety of performance types, including: singing, playing musical instruments, weaving tales, or telling jokes. Whether performing to an audience or speaking to an individual, bards will excel. There are many schools and guilds where members of this profession come together to bond and train, but there is a fair amount of ego within those of the bardic persuasion. While they may be the most likely to bring people together, a bard of ill temper can just as easily tear a party apart.

- **Play the Wordsmith** if you want to use clever wordplay and captivate crowds.

# Druid

![[druid.webp|205x256]]

Becoming a druid is more than an occupation, it’s a calling to those who wish to learn from and protect the magic of the wilderness. Those druids who practice the often quiet work of channeling flora are likely to be underestimated; while those who channel the brutal forces of animals may be a terrifying thing to behold. Druids are known to cultivate their abilities in small groups, often connected by a specific ethos or locale. Through years of study and dedication, druids can learn to transform into beasts and shape the earth and all its organisms.

Class Foundations: *Warden of the Elements* or *Warden of Renewal*

# Guardian

![[guardian.webp|205x256]]

Guardians represent an array of martial professions, and such a title speaks more to their moral compass and incredible fortitude than the means by which they fight. Those of this class may choose to join groups of militants, for either a country or cause, but guardians are more likely to follow those few they truly care for, majority be damned. Guardians are known for fighting with remarkable ferocity even against overwhelming odds, and are more likely to utilize defensive tactics that protect their cohort than charge forward with abandon. Woe be unto those who harm the ally of a guardian, as they will not soon forget such a grievance.

Class Foundations: *Stalwart* or *Vengeance*

- **Play the Stalwart** if you want to take heavy blows and keep fighting.

# Ranger

![[ranger.webp|205x256]]

Rangers are highly skilled hunters who, despite their martial abilities, will rarely lend their skills to an army. Through mastery of the body and a deep understanding of the wilderness, rangers transform themselves into sly tacticians, accustomed to fighting without the aid of an organized military force. Many rangers do, however, fight alongside an animal companion, with whom they’ve forged a powerful, spiritual bond. By honing their skills in the wild, rangers become expert hunters and trackers, and are as likely to catch their foes in a trap as assail them head-on.

Class Foundations: *Wayfinder* or *Beastbound*

- **Play the Wayfinder** if you want to hunt your prey using deadly force.
- **Play the Beastbound** if you want to form a deep bond with an animal ally.

# Rogue

![[rogue.webp|205x256]]

Rogues are scoundrels, often in both attitude and practice. Broadly known as liars and thieves, the best among this class move through the world entirely unknown. Utilizing their sharp wit and blade, rogues may trick their foes through social manipulation as easily as breaking locks or climbing through windows. Rogues frequently establish guilds to meet future accomplices, hire out jobs, and hone heavily-guarded skills, proving that the phrase “there’s no honor among thieves” is just another lie added to their arsenal.

Class Foundations: *Nightwalker* or *Syndicate*

- **Play the Nightwalker** if you want to use the manipulation of shadows to maneuver through your environment.
- **Play the Syndicate** if you want to have useful contacts everywhere you go.

# Seraph

![[seraph.webp|205x256]]

Divine fighters and healers appointed by their god, seraphs are imbued with sacred purpose. A wide array of deities exist within the realms, and thus there are numerous different types of seraph. The ethos of each member of this class traditionally aligns with the domain of their god including such missions as: defending the weak, enacting vengeance, protecting a land or artifact, and upholding a faith. Some seraph ally themselves with an army or locale, much to the satisfaction of their rulers, but some of these crusaders fight in opposition to the follies of the Mortal Realm. It is better to be an ally to a seraph, as they are terrifying foes to those who defy their purpose.

# Sorcerer

![[sorcerer.webp|205x256]]

Not all innate magic users choose to hone their craft, but those who do can become powerful sorcerers. The gifts of these wielders is passed down through families, though not all families are aware of, much less choose to practice, their unique skills. A sorcerer’s abilities can range from the elemental, to the illusionary, and beyond, and many members of this class will band together into collectives based on their talents. The act of becoming a formidable sorcerer is not the practice of acquiring power, but learning to control and hone the power one already possesses. The magic within a misguided or uneducated sorcerer is a dangerous force indeed.

# Warrior

![[warrior.webp|205x256]]

Becoming a warrior requires years, often a lifetime, of training and dedication to the mastery of violence and weapons. While many who seek to fight only hone their strength, warriors understand the importance of an agile body and mind, making them some of the most sought after fighters across the realms. Many warriors will find employment within an army, band of mercenaries, or even within a royal guard, but their potential is wasted in any position where they cannot continue to hone and expand their skills. Warriors are known to have a favored weapon, and to come between one of this class and their blade would be a grievous mistake.

- **Play the Call of the Slayer** if you want to strike down adversaries with incredible power.
- **Play the Call of the Brave** if you want to use the might of your enemies to fuel you.

# Wizard

![[wizard.webp|205x256]]

Those who acquire their magical power through years of study are known as wizards. Whether through an institution or individual study, wizards use a variety of tools—including books, scrolls, or ancient tablets—to hone their craft. Often, wizards will dedicate their life to the mastery of a particular school of magic, while others will attempt to learn from a wide variety of disciplines. Many wizards go on to become wise and powerful figures in their communities, advising rulers, providing medicines, and even leading war councils. While all members of this class work toward the common goal of collecting magical knowledge, it is very often that wizards have the most conflict within their own ranks; as the acquisition, keeping, and sharing of powerful secrets is a topic of intense debate that has resulted in thousands upon thousands of deaths.
