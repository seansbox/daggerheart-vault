# Clank

![[clank-playtest.webp|320x256]]

*Clanks are sentient mechanical beings built from a variety of materials including metal and wood.*

- **Purposeful Design:** Decide who you were created by and for what purpose. Choose an experience you have that reflects this and increase it by +1.
- **Efficient:** When you take a short rest, you can substitute a long rest move for one of your short rest moves.

Like organic beings, their bodies come in a wide array of sizes and may change and adapt based on time and need. Because of their custom construction, many clanks have highly specialized physical features. Examples include clawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in weaponry. Many clanks are known to embrace an individual’s desires for body modifications—including those based in style as well as function—and members of other ancestries might turn to clank artisans to construct highly customized mobility aids and physical adornments. Other ancestries can create clanks, even using their own physical features as inspiration, but it’s also common for clanks to build one another. A clank's lifespan extends as long as they're able to acquire or craft new parts, making their physical form effectively immortal. That said, their minds are subject to the effects of time and will deteriorate as the magic that powers them loses potency.

# Drakona

![[drakona-playtest.webp|320x256]]

*Drakona resemble wingless dragons in humanoid form and possess a powerful elemental breath.*

- **Elemental Breath:** Choose an element for your breath (ice, fire, electricity, etc.). You can use this breath against a target or group of targets within Very Close range, treating it as an Instinct weapon that deals d8 magic damage using your Proficiency.

All drakona have thick scales that provide excellent natural armor against both the forces of nature and attacks. They are large in size (ranging from 5 feet to 7 feet on average) with equally large and naturally sharp teeth. Drakona perpetually grow their teeth throughout their approximately 350-year lifespan, so members of this ancestry are never in danger of permanently losing an incisor. Unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona do not have wings and cannot fly without magical aid. Members of this ancestry each possess elemental breath, the type of which is passed down through the generations of each drakona family.

# Dwarf

![[dwarf-playtest.webp|320x256]]

*Dwarves are most easily recognized as short humanoids with square features, dense musculature, and thick hair.*

Some elves possess what is known as a “Mystic Form,” which occurs when an individual has dedicated themselves to a portion of the natural world so deeply that their physical form has changed. These characteristics can include celestial freckles, the presence of leaves, vines, or flowers in their skin or hair, and more. Sometimes these traits are inherited from an elf’s parents, but if the individual chooses to move their focus away from that sphere of influence, portions of their appearance will adjust over time. Because elves live for about 350 years, these traits might change more than once throughout their lifespan.

# Faerie
